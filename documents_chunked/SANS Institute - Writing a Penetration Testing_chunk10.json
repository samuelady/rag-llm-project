The result of the assessment is then analyzed for vulnerabilities. Given the limited time that is given to perform the assessment, only immediately exploitable services have been tested. The vulnerabilities are assigned a risk rating based on threat, vulnerability and impact. 1.3. Assumption While writing the report, we assume that both IP addresses are considered to be public IP addresses, NDA and rules of engagement has been signed and based on the information gathering phase the company name is GPEN.KM. 1.4.

Figure 1 Total Risks GPEN.KM needs to pay more attention to information security. We were able to access one server in less than one hour. GPEN.KM needs to invest in implementing a defense-in-depth approach to have multiple layers of security to protect their information asset. Other areas such as processes and people should be emphasized as well. Systems and networks hardening and secure configurations, for instance, should be implemented to strengthen the different layers of security within GPEN.KM . Below are the high level findings from the external penetration test: • GPEN.KM lacks a defense in depth (multi-layered) security strategy which if implemented will help GPEN.KM achieves better security level. )*+,%\"&(!.$*&/01(2$*&/0342*0.-5%2( ( ( @ 2021 SANS Institute Author Retains Full Rights\\n! !
