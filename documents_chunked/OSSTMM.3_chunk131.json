{"text": "Security Test Audit Report. Its purpose is to serve as an executive summary of precise calculation stating the Attack Surface of the targets tested within a particular scope. This precision is made through the requirement of specifically noting what was NOT tested in addition to what has been tested in accordance to the OSSTMM. The provided template is to be filled out completely (a copy of this template by itself can be found at the ISECOM website) and signed by the Analyst. It is then provided either to ISECOM with the scope owner’s explicit permission or directly to the scope owner along with the full security test report. It is not a substitute for a full report. When providing the STAR to ISECOM for verification, it is printed, signed by the verification auditor, and stamped by ISECOM. A certificate is provided for all tests which state the scope has been tested and verified. There is no passing or failing since there is no particular Attack Surface rav value that exists for all scopes as the cut-off between one that passes and one that fails. However, rav values for a scope above 90% will be marked by a stamp of excellence.
