{"text": "course of testing, Hack The Box Academy uncovered a total of seven (7) findings that pose a material risk to Inlanefreight’s information systems. Hack The Box Academy also identified one informational finding that, if addressed, could further strengthen Inlanefreight’s overall security posture. Informational findings are observations for areas of improvement by the organization and do not represent security vulnerabilities on their own. The below table provides a summary of the findings by severity level. Finding Severity High Medium Low Total 5 1 1 7 Table 2: Severity Summary Below is a high-level overview of each finding identified during testing. These findings are covered in depth in the Technical Findings Details section of this report. Finding # Severity Level Finding Name 1. High LLMNR/NBT-NS Response Spoofing 2. High Weak Kerberos Authentication (“Kerberoasting”) 3. High Local Administrator Password Re-Use 4. High Weak Active Directory Passwords 5. High Tomcat Manager Weak/Default Credentials High 6. Medium Insecure File Shares 7. Low Directory Listing Enabled 8. Info Enhance Security Monitoring Capabilities Table 3: Finding List 8\\nInternal Network Compromise Walkthrough During the course of the assessment Hack The Box Academy was able gain a foothold and compromise the internal network, leading to full administrative control over the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL Active Directory domain. The steps below demonstrate the steps taken from initial access to compromise and does not include all vulnerabilities and misconfigurations discovered during the course of testing. Any issues not used as part of the path to compromise are listed as separate, standalone issues in the Technical Findings Details section, ranked by severity level. The intent of this attack chain is to demonstrate to Inlanefreight the impact of each vulnerability shown in this report and how they fit together to demonstrate the overall risk to the client environment and help to prioritize remediation efforts (i.e., patching two flaws quickly could break up the attack chain while the company works to remediate all issues reported). While other findings shown in this report could be leveraged to gain a similar level of access, this attack chain shows the initial path of least resistance taken by the tester to achieve domain compromise. Detailed Walkthrough Hack The Box Academy performed the following to fully compromise the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain. 1. The tester utilized the Responder tool to obtain an NTLMv2 password hash for a domain user, bsmith. 2. This password hash was successfully cracked offline using the Hashcat tool to reveal the user's clear text password which granted a foothold into the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain, but with no more privileges than a standard domain user. 3. The tester then ran the BloodHound.py, a Python version of the popular SharpHound collection tool to enumerate the domain and create visual representations of attack paths. Upon review, the tester found that multiple privileged users existed in the domain configured with Service Principal Names (SPNs), which can be leveraged to perform a Kerberoasting attack and retrieve TGS Kerberos tickets for the accounts which can be cracked offline using Hashcat if a weak password is set.
