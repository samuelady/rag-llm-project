{"text": "that is, Analysts have presumed knowledge of the law. Analysts are considered professionals in this subject matter and, therefore, the assumption exists that even regarding what may not be common knowledge for the average person about a foreign region’s laws regarding EM and MW communication systems, will be known to the Analyst. 2. In personam: Testing must specifically target only SPECSEC from personnel who are under direct legal contract with the scope owner, computer systems on the property of the scope owner, and EM or MW signals or emanations of power level great enough to disrupt or harm wireless communications within the scope. Analysts must make efforts to not invade upon a person’s private life such as listening to or recording personal communications originating within the scope, where that private life has made efforts to separate itself from the scope.

This review forms a matrix to which testing should be mapped but not constrained. 9.1.1 Policy Review and document appropriate organizational policy regarding security, integrity, and privacy responsibilities of the scope. Review and document contracts and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with service providers and other involved third parties. 9.1.2 Legislation Review and document appropriate regional and national legislation and industry regulations regarding the security and privacy requirements of the organization in the scope as well as that which includes the appropriate customers, partners, organizational branches, or resellers outside the scope. 9.1.3 Culture Review and document appropriate organizational culture in the scope towards security and privacy awareness, required and available personnel training, organizational hierarchy, help desk use, and requirements for reporting security issues. 9.1.4 Age Review and document the age of systems, software, and service applications required for operations. 9.1.5 Fragile Artifacts Review and document any systems, software, and service applications which require special care due to high use, instabilities, or a high rate of change.

For example, is a wireless access point (AP) available 24/7 or just during normal business hours? 9.3 Active Detection Verification Determination of active and passive controls to detect intrusion to filter or deny test attempts must be made prior to testing to mitigate the risk of creating false positives and negatives in the test result data as", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 101}}
