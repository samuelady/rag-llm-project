In COMSEC data networks, count each server and service which a network-based intrusion detection system monitors. Or, count each 10 Alarm service that maintains a monitored log of interaction. access logs count, even if they are not used to send a notification alert immediately, unless they are never monitored. However, logs which are not designed to be used for such notifications, such as a counter of packets sent and received, do not classify as an alarm as there is too little data stored.

The values of each Limitation are dependent on Porosity and Controls. This is different from the more common risk perspective where a vulnerability may be assigned a risk level based on what damage it can do, how easy it is to do, and the distance in range for the attack. Therefore the Limitation values are calculated based on the Porosity and Controls of the target they can be found on. Category Description Count separately each flaw or error that defies protections whereby a person or process can access, deny access to others, or hide itself or assets within the scope. In PHYSSEC, a vulnerability can be as simple as a glass door, a metal gate corroded by the weather, a door that can be sealed by wedging coins into the gap between it and its frame, electronic equipment not sealed from pests such as ants or mice, a bootable CD drive on a PC, or a process that allows an employee to take a trashcan large enough to hide or transport assets out of the scope. In HUMSEC, a vulnerability can be a cultural bias that does not allow an employee to question others who look out of place or a lack of training which leaves a new secretary to give out business information classified for internal use only. In COMSEC data security, a vulnerability can be a flaw in software that allows an attacker to overwrite memory space to gain access, a 1 Vulnerability computation flaw that allows an attacker to lock the CPU into 100% usage, or an operating system that allows enough data to be copied onto the disk until it cannot operate anymore. In COMSEC telecommunications, a vulnerability can be a flaw in the pay phone system that allows sounds through the receiver to mimic coin drops, a telephone box that allows anyone to access anyone else’s phone line, a voice mail system that provides messages from any phone anywhere, or a FAX machine that can be polled remotely to resend the last thing in memory to the caller’s number. In SPECSEC, a vulnerability can be hardware which can be overloaded and burnt", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 62}}
