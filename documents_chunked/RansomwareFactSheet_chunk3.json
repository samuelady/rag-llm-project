If an entity believes that a ransomware attack is underway, either because of indicators similar to those above or other methods of detection, the entity should immediately activate its security incident response plan, which should include measures to isolate the infected computer systems in order to halt propagation of the attack. Additionally, it is recommended that an entity infected with ransomware contact its local FBI or United States Secret Service field office. These agencies work with Federal, state, local and international partners to pursue cyber criminals globally and assist victims of cybercrime. 5. What should covered entities or business associates do if their computer systems are infected with ransomware? The presence of ransomware (or any malware) on a covered entity’s or business associate’s computer systems is a security incident under the HIPAA Security Rule. A security incident is defined as the attempted or successful unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction of information or interference with system operations in an information system. See the definition of security incident at 45 C.F.R. 164.304. Once the ransomware is detected, the covered entity or business associate must initiate its security incident and response and reporting procedures. See 45 C.F.R. 164.308(a)(6). HIPAA covered entities and business associates are required to develop and implement security incident procedures and response and reporting processes that they believe are reasonable and appropriate to respond to malware and other security incidents, including ransomware attacks. Entities seeking guidance regarding the implementation of security incident procedures may wish to review NIST SP 800- 61 Rev. 2, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide5 for additional information. An entity’s security incident response activities should begin with an initial analysis to: 5 Available at http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf 4\\n• determine the scope of the incident to identify what networks, systems, or applications are affected; • determine the origination of the incident (who/what/where/when); • determine whether the incident is finished, is ongoing or has propagated additional incidents throughout the environment; and • determine how the incident occurred (e.g., tools and attack methods used, vulnerabilities exploited). These initial steps should assist the entity in prioritizing subsequent incident response activities and serve as a foundation for conducting a deeper analysis of the incident and its impact. Subsequent security incident response activities should include steps to: • contain the impact and propagation of the ransomware; • eradicate the instances of ransomware and mitigate or remediate vulnerabilities that permitted the ransomware attack and propagation; • recover from the ransomware attack by restoring data lost during the attack and returning", "metadata": {"doc_id": "RansomwareFactSheet", "chunk_id": 3}}
