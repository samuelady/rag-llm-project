{"text": "surface. The Technical Findings section expands upon the report overview by including each discovered vulnerability’s evaluated risk, exploitation details, and recommended remediation steps. Based upon the results of the assessment, AEC is at risk to be fined by payment providers due to severe PCI DSS violations. These fines could range from $5,000 to $100,000 per month depending on factors such as size of business [1]. Based on these issues, we suggest spending resources to become complaint. Details of all PCI DSS violations can be found in Section 2.3.1. New Haven Hacking Inc. was able to gain full access to a SCADA system using the default credentials. This device is extremely important as it is critical to industrial systems which operate the storage, delivery, and packaging warehouse facility. Similarly, the industrial control device is not isolated in any way, could be manipulated by any user on the network. It is important to take this with extreme caution, as malicious tampering with these devices couldresultinlossoflife. Thiswouldresultinunwantedattention, couldharmthecompanies reputation, and could cost AECvast sums of money from both lawsuits and long term loss of business. During this engagement, a total of 11 vulnerabilities were found in AEC’s network. In terms ofseverity, 3vulnerabilitiesarecritical, 3vulnerabilitiesarehigh, 1vulnerabilityismoderate, and 4 vulnerabilities posed low risk. Many of the vulnerabilities in the environment are due to improper authentication, default credentials, or not applying principles of least privileges. More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in Section 4. Page 2\\n1.2 Engagement Overview New Haven Hacking Inc. conducted a penetration test starting on January 7th, 2022 based upon the Request for Proposal (RFP) document obtained by New Haven Hacking Inc.. Focus was placed on the following goals during the engagement: • Assessing internally developed and customized software packages. • Assessment of Industrial controls within a storage, delivery, and packing warehouse facility. • Assessment of APIs related to payment, transaction, billing, and inventory processing systems. • Discovering vulnerabilities and complications which could impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of AEC’s information systems. • Assisting AEC in improving their security posture. • Evaluate AEC’s security posture against the Payment Card Industry - Digital Security Standard (PCI-DSS). 1.3 Scope of Engagement The full scope of this penetration test was limited to the following CIDR range. At the request of AEC , the first day of the engagement (Jan 7 2022) excluded hosts 10.0.17.50 and 10.0.17.51 in order to ensure availability of critical infrastructure. These hosts were included on the second day (Jan 8th starting at 9:20AM) to ensure proper testing. Care was taken by New Haven Hacking Inc. to ensure penetration test activity did not reduce the availability of industrial systems. • 10.0.17.0/24 The penetration test was conducted with extreme care to ensure actions were contained within the defined scope. Additionally, because the engagement was within a production environment, the team ensured that no services were disrupted. New Haven Hacking Inc. did not exfiltrate, modify, or delete any data not included in this report.
