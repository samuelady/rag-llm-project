Abuse of discretion: The Analyst must take care not to ignore or misinterpret the results from testing a physical barrier or obstacle because it is not within the range of the Analystâ€™s physical possibilities. The Analyst should remain unbiased and not over-estimate or over-value personal skills and ability and instead apply the tests as a highly skilled and highly able person could. 4. Magister pecuarius: The Analyst should not dismiss the reasonable potential of an attacker using trained animals to circumvent barriers and obstacles where a human being cannot. 5. Plausible deniability: No direct or physical personnel security testing will take place for personnel who have not been trained, informed, or can be said to possess security awareness experience or obligations due to job responsibility requirements. 6. Sui generis: All interaction with physical barriers will leave record of this interactivity and, in more extreme cases, may weaken or destroy the barrier. The Analyst should take care in testing one-of- a-kind type targets which may not be replaceable. The Analyst should also take care not to leave permanent markings wherever possible and to keep record of all barriers tested to verify them for damage after the audit.
