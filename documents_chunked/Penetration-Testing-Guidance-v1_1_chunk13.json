In many environments, active protection controls such as an intrusion prevention system or web active protection systems such as intrusion protection systems (IPS) and web application firewalls (WAF) may be deployed to protect exposed services. Because the intent of the penetration test is to evaluate the services’ susceptibility to exploitation (vs. the active protection systems’ ability to prevent attacks), interference with the penetration test should be avoided—entities are encouraged to review and be familiar with the section titled “Scan Interference” in the ASV Program Guide and configure active protection systems accordingly during testing. This practice helps ensure that the services themselves are configured properly and have the minimal risk of being exploited in the event the active protection system fails or is somehow defeated or bypassed by an attacker. 4.2 Engagement: Penetration Testing Each environment has unique aspects/technology that requires the tester select the most appropriate approach and the tools necessary to perform the penetration test. It is beyond the scope of this document to define or outline which approach, tools, or techniques are appropriate for each penetration test. Instead, the following sections provide high-level guidance on considerations for the approach, tools, or techniques. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 17\\nPenetration testing is essentially a manual endeavor. In many cases, tools exist that can aid the tester in performing the test and alleviate some of the repetitive tasks. Judgment is required in selecting the appropriate tools and in identifying attack vectors that typically cannot be identified through automated means. Penetration testing should also be performed from a suitable location, with no restrictions on ports or services by the Internet provider. For example, a penetration tester utilizing Internet connectivity provided to consumers and residences may have SMTP, SNMP, SMB, and other ports restricted by the Internet provider to minimize impact by viruses and malware. If testing is performed by a qualified internal resource, the test should also be performed from a neutral Internet connection unaffected by access controls that might be present from the corporate or support environments. 4.2.1 Application Layer As mentioned in Section 2.3, the penetration tester should perform testing from the perspective of the defined roles of the application. The organization is strongly encouraged to supply credentials to allow the tester to assume the required roles. This will", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Penetration-Testing-Guidance-v1_1", "chunk_id": 13}}
