The weighting of the Vulnerabilities, Weaknesses and Concerns are based on a relationship between the Porosity or OpSec , the Loss Controls and in the case sum of Exposures and Anomaly the existence of other Limitations also plays a role. An Exposure or Anomaly poses no problems alone unless a Vulnerability, Weakness or Concern is also present. Think of an Exposure like a pointer. If there is a pointer that goes nowhere, or in this case doesn’t lead to anything exploitable (Vulnerability, Weakness, Concern) and all Controls are accounted for, then at the time of the test the Exposure has no effect on security and thus has no value in the rav. The following value table is used to calculate the SecLim variable, as an intermediate step between sum the Security Limitation inputs and the SecLim variable, which is the Security Limitations basic input for base the rav equation.
