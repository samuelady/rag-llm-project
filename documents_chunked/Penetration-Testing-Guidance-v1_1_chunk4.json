All penetration testing should only be conducted as defined by the rules of engagement agreed upon by both parties. See Section 4.1.3, “Rules of Engagement.” The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 7\\n2.2.1 External Penetration Test The scope of an external penetration test is the exposed external perimeter of the CDE and critical systems connected or accessible to public network infrastructures. It should assess any unique access to the scope from the public networks, including services that have access restricted to individual external IP addresses. Testing must include both application-layer and network-layer assessments. External penetration tests also include remote access vectors such as dial-up and VPN connections. 2.2.2 Internal Penetration Test The scope of the internal penetration test is the internal perimeter of the CDE and critical systems from the perspective of the internal network. Testing must include both application-layer and network-layer assessments. Where the CDE is also the only internal network and there is no internal CDE perimeter, the scope of testing will typically be focused on critical systems. For example, testing activities may include attempting to bypass internal access controls intended to prevent unauthorized access or use of systems that store, process, or transmit CHD from those that do not. In cases where there is an internal CDE perimeter, the scope of testing will need to consider the CDE perimeter as well as critical systems within and outside of the CDE. For example, the testing may attempt to exploit permitted access paths from systems on an internal network segment into the CDE. When access to the CDE is obtained as a result of the testing, the scope of the penetration test may allow the tester to continue exploring inside the network and further the attack against other systems within the CDE, and may also include testing any data-exfiltration prevention (data-loss prevention) controls that are in place. In all cases, the scope of internal testing should consider the specific environment and the entity’s risk assessment. Entities are encouraged to consult with their assessor and the penetration tester to ensure the scope of the penetration test is sufficient and appropriate for their particular environment. 2.2.3 Testing Segmentation Controls The intent of segmentation is to prevent out-of-scope systems from being able to communicate with systems in the CDE or impact the security of the CDE. When properly implemented, a segmented (out-of- scope) system component could not impact the security of the CDE, even if an attacker obtained control of the out-of-scope system. If segmentation controls are implemented, testing of the controls is required to confirm that the segmentation methods are working as intended and that all out-of-scope systems and networks are isolated from systems in the CDE. The scope of segmentation testing should consider any networks and systems considered as being out of", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Penetration-Testing-Guidance-v1_1", "chunk_id": 4}}
