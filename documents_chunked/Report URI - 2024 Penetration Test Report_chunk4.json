However, it is unlikely that Cloudflare Bot Management would have prevented this brute-force attempt under normal conditions, as only 6 requests were issued within a short time frame. The limited request volume would likely not trigger typical rate-limiting or anomaly detection mechanisms, making this vulnerability feasible for exploitation in scenarios with similar traffic patterns. 5.2.4 Recommendation Pentest recommends implementing anti-automation controls on the affected forms. By significantly delaying the success of a password-guessing attack, it provides an effective deterrent to attackers. Consider the following options to reduce the effectiveness of automated bot attacks: • CAPTCHA can help prevent automated bots by requiring manual interactions from a human. For example, Google’s ReCAPTCHA asks the user to identify an object (such as a car or traffic light) from a photo. • Rate-Limiting Requests simply reduces the number of requests an attacker can be made within reasonable time period to the server. 5.2.5 References [1] OWASP: Automated Threats to Web Applications 5.2.6 Affected Item(s) • https://report-uri.com Confidential 12\\n6 6 Additional Information 6.1 WHOIS Database The WHOIS database stores information about the individual or organisation who owns and manages a domain or IP address range. Attackers will review WHOIS entries trying to find useful information such as names and contact details for employees. Best practices state that generic contact details should be used such as “whois@domain.com” rather than providing the name of a member of staff. 6.1.1 Entry for Domain: report-uri.com Domain Name: REPORT-URI.COM Registry Domain ID: 1651365076_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN Registrar WHOIS Server: whois.namecheap.com Registrar URL: http://www.namecheap.com Updated Date: 2024-03-18T08:02:32Z Creation Date: 2011-04-17T11:55:31Z Registry Expiry Date: 2025-04-17T11:55:31Z Registrar: NameCheap, Inc.
