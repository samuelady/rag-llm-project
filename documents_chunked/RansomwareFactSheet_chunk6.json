{"text": "attack affecting the integrity of PHI through the implementation of robust contingency plans including disaster recovery and data backup plans. Conducting frequent backups and ensuring the ability to recover data from backups is crucial to recovering from a ransomware attack and ensuring the integrity of PHI affected by ransomware. Test restorations should be periodically conducted to verify the integrity of backed up data and provide confidence in an organization’s data restoration capabilities. Integrity to PHI data is only one aspect when considering to what extent the risk to PHI has been mitigated. Additional aspects, including whether or not PHI has been exfiltrated, should also be considered when determining the extent to which the risk to PHI has been mitigated. The risk assessment to determine whether there is a low probability of compromise of the PHI must be thorough, completed in good faith and reach conclusions that are reasonable given the circumstances. Furthermore, in accordance with 45 C.F.R. 164.530(j)(iv)), covered entities and business associates must maintain supporting documentation sufficient to meet their burden of proof (see 45 C.F.R. 164.414) regarding the breach assessment – and if applicable, notification - process including: • documentation of the risk assessment demonstrating the conclusions reached; • documentation of any exceptions determined to be applicable to the impermissible use or disclosure (see 45 C.F.R. 164.402(1)) of the PHI; and • documentation demonstrating that all notifications were made, if a determination was made that the impermissible use or disclosure was a reportable breach. 8. Is it a reportable breach if the ePHI encrypted by the ransomware was already encrypted to comply with HIPAA? This is a fact specific determination. The HIPAA breach notification provisions apply to “unsecured PHI” (see 45 C.F.R. 164.402), which is protected health information (PHI) that is not secured through the use of a technology or methodology specified by the Secretary in guidance. If the electronic PHI (ePHI) is encrypted by the entity in a manner consistent with the Guidance to Render Unsecured Protected Health Information Unusable, Unreadable, or Indecipherable to Unauthorized Individuals7 such that it is no longer “unsecured PHI,” then the entity is not required to conduct a risk assessment to determine if there is a low probability of compromise, and breach notification is not required. 7 Available at http://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/breach-notification/guidance/index.html 7\\nHowever, even if the PHI is encrypted in accordance with the HHS guidance, additional analysis may still be required to ensure that the encryption solution, as implemented, has rendered the affected PHI unreadable, unusable and indecipherable to unauthorized persons. A full disk encryption solution may render the data on a computer system’s hard drive unreadable, unusable and indecipherable to unauthorized persons while the computer system (such as a laptop) is powered down. Once the computer system is powered on and the operating system is loaded, however, many full disk encryption solutions will transparently decrypt and encrypt files accessed by the user. For example, if a laptop encrypted with a full disk encryption solution in a manner consistent with HHS guidance8 is properly", "metadata": {"doc_id": "RansomwareFactSheet", "chunk_id": 6}}
