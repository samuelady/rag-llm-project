{"text": "target of hate or are we a moment of opportunity for them? As a result, we’re pressured to develop tactics that can somehow be equally effective against a diverse and rapidly growing variety of potential attacks. Worse, our defenses also have to take into account the operational needs of the business. Not only do we need to stop attacks, we also need to ensure our security measures don’t also slow or stop any processes or services. An attacker has no such limitations. As such, the first thing any game plan for our security efforts has to take into account is that attackers and defenders aren’t playing by the same rules. The playing field is anything but level. An attacker only has to be effective against one specific aspect of our defense — by any means possible — in order to be successful. As a defender, meanwhile, we have to be effective against all manner of potential attacks. And we have to operate under economical limitations, legal restrictions, and industry regulations. With the game so stacked against us, what does a winning strategy for defenders look like? THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 2: THE GAME PLAN 11 Create a Zone Defense You can’t go one-on-one with an opponent you can’t see coming. To counter an attacker’s advantages in terms of flexibility and surprise, you need to develop a zone defense. In sports, a zone is a means of separating the field into areas of focused defense. The idea is that by creating separation, you can ensure that a threat either cannot physically reach an asset or that it encounters an increased defense when it does. Establishing separation is at the heart of any effective defensive strategy, and the first step toward assuring security. To achieve it, build your game plan around the following: 1. Create zones by logically and physically separating services and assets from each other. Ex: Assets of one department should only be accessible to that department or group. All system accesses should be directly whitelisted (limited to a list of predetermined authorized types) through a switch and a firewall. 2. Create zones across your remote (vendor or cloud) accounts by using a separate login and secret sentence for each. Re-using passwords across vendors is the fastest and easiest way to get accounts compromised. Personal certificates and private key cryptography are much stronger than even secret sentences and should be used for administrative (root) access to external services. However, be sure to protect even those keys and certificates with a “secret sentence” — a password that is a complete sentence with capitalization and punctuation that means something to you so you’ll remember it. For example, a secret sentence for Facebook might be, I just wasted 2 hours on Facebook! For your VoIP provider, it might be, Boss says, “No more big bills.” complete with all the punctuation. 3. Create trust zones in the network where no system is directly accessible to another system. Ex: Desktops should not be able", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Playbook", "chunk_id": 6}}
