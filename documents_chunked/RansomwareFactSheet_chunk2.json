See 45 C.F.R. 164.308(a)(7). During the course of responding to a ransomware attack, an entity may find it necessary to activate its contingency or business continuity plans. Once activated, an entity will be able to continue its business operations while continuing to respond to and recover from a ransomware attack. Maintaining confidence in contingency plans and data recovery is critical for effective incident response, whether the incident is a ransomware attack or fire or natural disaster. Security incident procedures, including procedures for responding to and reporting security incidents, are also required by HIPAA. See 45 C.F.R. 164.308(a)(6). An entity’s security incident procedures should prepare it to respond to various types of security incidents, including ransomware attacks. Robust security incident procedures for responding to a ransomware attack should include processes to4: • detect and conduct an initial analysis of the ransomware; • contain the impact and propagation of the ransomware; • eradicate the instances of ransomware and mitigate or remediate vulnerabilities that permitted the ransomware attack and propagation; • recover from the ransomware attack by restoring data lost during the attack and returning to “business as usual” operations; and • conduct post-incident activities, which could include a deeper analysis of the evidence to determine if the entity has any regulatory, contractual or other obligations as a result of the incident (such as providing notification of a breach of protected health information), and incorporating any lessons learned into the overall security management process of the entity to improve incident response effectiveness for future security incidents. 4. How can covered entities or business associates detect if their computer systems are infected with ransomware? Unless ransomware is detected and propagation halted by an entity’s malicious software protection or other security measures, an entity would typically be alerted to the presence of ransomware only after the ransomware has encrypted the user’s data and alerted the user to its presence to demand payment. However, in some cases, an entity’s workforce may notice early indications of a ransomware attack that has evaded the entity’s security measures. HIPAA’s requirement that an entity’s workforce receive appropriate security training, including training for detecting and reporting instances of malicious 4 Adapted from NIST SP 800-61Rev. 2, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide. 3\\nsoftware, can thus assist entities in preparing their staff to detect and respond to ransomware. Indicators of a ransomware attack could include: • a user’s realization that a link that was clicked on, a file attachment opened, or a website visited may have been malicious in nature; • an increase in activity in the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer and disk activity for no apparent reason (due to the ransomware searching for, encrypting and removing data files); • an inability to access certain files as the ransomware encrypts, deletes and re-names and/or re- locates", "metadata": {"doc_id": "RansomwareFactSheet", "chunk_id": 2}}
