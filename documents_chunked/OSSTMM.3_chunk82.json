Intervention Phase These tests are focused on the resources the targets require in the scope. Those resources can be switched, changed, overloaded, or starved to cause penetration or disruption. This is often the final phase of a security test to assure disruptions do not affect responses of less invasive tests and because the information for making these tests may not be known until other phases have been carried out. The final module, D.17, of Alert and Log Review, is required to verify prior tests which provided no interactivity back to the Analyst. Most security tests that do not include this phase may still need to run an end review from the perspective of the targets and assets to clarify any anomalies.
