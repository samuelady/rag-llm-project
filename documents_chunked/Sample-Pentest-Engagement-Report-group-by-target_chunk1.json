Findings (grouped by target) 4.1 Target: https://pentest-ground.com:4280/ 4.1.1 Remote File Inclusion Affected target https://pentest-ground.com:4280/ Status: Open Evidence URL https://pentest-ground.com:4280/vulnerabilities/fi/ Method GET Vulnerable Parameter page (Query Parameter) Evidence Injecting the remote file URL https://pentest- tools.com/file.txt in the page query parameter resulted in the content of the remote file being present in the response. Request / Response Vulnerability description We found that the target web application is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attacks. This vulnerability occurs when the application allows external files to be included and executed within its environment. 11\\nRisk description The risk varies greatly, depending on the behaviour of programming language used on the server. The impact can range from client side vulnerabilities, like Cross-Site Scripting, to server side issues, like Remote Code Execution. If the programming language functionality used to import the resource just embeds the remote file content in the HTTP response, you are looking at impact on the client-side. On the other hand, if the content is treated and interpreted as code on the server, you are potentially dealing with Remote-Code Execution. Recommendation The most effective solution to eliminating file inclusion vulnerabilities is to avoid passing raw user-submitted input to any filesystem API. If this is not possible, the application can maintain a white list of files that may be included by the page, and then", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Sample-Pentest-Engagement-Report-group-by-target", "chunk_id": 1}}
