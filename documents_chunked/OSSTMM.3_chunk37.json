This type of security through obscurity may be dangerous, as the bias will shift when tests come from different vectors or employ different techniques. It is also likely that the target is not aware of the bias.

The target is a biased sample of a larger system or a larger number of possible states. This error normally occurs when an authority influences the 9 Sampling Error operational state of the target for the duration of the test. This may be through specific time constraints on the test or a bias of testing only components designated as “important” within a system. This type of error will cause a misrepresentation of the overall operational security. The answer changes depending on the limitations of the tools used. The limitations of human senses or equipment capabilities indicate a 10 Constraint particular state as either true or false although the actual state is unknown. This error is not caused by poor judgment or wrong equipment choices rather it is a failure to recognize imposed constraints or limitations. The answer is presumed to be of one state or the other although no test was made. The Analyst does not make a particular test or has a bias to ignore a particular result due to a presumed outcome. This is often a blinding from experience or a confirmation bias. The test may be repeated many times or the tools and equipment may be modified to have the desired 11 Propagation outcome. As the name implies, a process that receives no feedback where the errors remain unknown or ignored will propagate further errors as the testing continues. Propagation errors may be dangerous because the errors propagated from early in testing may not be visible during an analysis of conclusions. Furthermore, a study of the entire test process is required to discover propagation errors. The answer changes depending on the skill of the Analyst. An error caused by lack of ability, experience, or comprehension is not one of bias and is always a factor that is present, regardless of methodology or technique. While an experienced Analyst may make propagation errors, 12 Human Error one without experience is more likely to not recognize human error, something that experience teaches to recognize and compensate for. Statistically, there is an indirect relationship between experience and human error. The less experience an Analyst has, the greater the amount of human error an audit may contain.

A simple self-assessment can create a margin of operation errors caused during the test which the Analyst can use to either frame", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 37}}
