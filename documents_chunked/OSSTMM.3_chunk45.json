{"text": "unknown like a black box which can’t be opened, the Analyst needs to address the controls over the system’s interactions in its environment. The process will look like this: 1. What is visible in the scope? What is of possible value that is known? What targets can be determined? 2. What are the interactive Access points to those targets and from what vector or channel? 3. What are the Trusts within the scope and over what vector or channel? 4. Which are the controls for those Accesses and Trusts? 5. Are the controls complete or do they have limitations? Even a quick application of the OpSec model will tell you if an Access or a Trust is balanced with controls. This will tell you the size of the attack surface and which interactive points are open without any controls to govern them.

This is adequate when looking for matching socks but not so good when looking at the big picture of an attack surface. It is the major problem known as pattern matching, the human trait to skip over steps, sometimes unknowingly, which are considered unnecessary due to an “obvious” outcome. It also makes people see cause and effect where there may be none. It is a blind spot which Analysts will develop after years of doing initial, basic, or redundant tasks. These tasks are made more efficient through short-cuts which affect the quality of the verification tests and ultimately the analysis. For actionable intelligence, a result is only as good as the methods used to get them. Not knowing how you got a particular result will severely limit the action you can take to fix it. When an Analyst uses pattern matching to skip steps, the method cannot be properly known. Still, the desire to “cut to the chase” to get to the meat of a problem while presuming a state which is actually unknown is a problem in many areas of science. Security is no exception. Therefore an Analyst must recognize when tests have been skipped or the data fudged to provide unverified results. To detect pattern matching, examine the test methods and result data for the following: 1. Tests using specific threats instead of a thorough interaction with the attack surface. 2. The lack of details on resulting processes behind interactions with the target. 3. Little or no information about controls for various targets. 4. Only some of the targets are reported for certain tests and those have completely negative results. 5. Targets not tested for reasons which are anecdotal (notes where a person has said there is nothing there to test or has been secured). 6. Tests of targets which have obviously not been secured. 3.4 Characterize the Results The scientific method is not a checklist. It is", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 45}}
