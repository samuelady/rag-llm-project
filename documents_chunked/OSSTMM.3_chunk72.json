The trust properties allow ordinary people who do not have this natural ability to analyze any of their trust decisions with skill, distancing themselves from their own under-developed “gut instinct” until they can recondition themselves to do so automatically, fluently, sharpening their instincts until they work “from the gut”.

Must the trust extend to just one or to many? Is the group to be a trusted one which is meant to make 1 Size collective decision? The vector (direction) of the trust. Trust may be one way (asymmetrical) and defined as to which way the trust must travel or 2 Symmetry both ways (symmetrical). A person who must also trust you has to consider the reciprocation from breaking the trust. The level of transparency of all operational parts and processes of the 3 Visibility target and its environment. Also called control, the amount of influence over the scope by the 4 Subjugation operator. The historical evidence of compromise or corruption of the target. 5 Consistency The amount and timely notice of change within the target. 6 Integrity The offsets of sufficient assurance are compensation for the trust giver or punishment for the trust breaker. It is a value placed on the trust 7 Offsets with the target. The financial offset for risk, the amount of win or gain for which the risk of putting trust in the target is sufficient to offset the risk of failure in the 8 Value trust. The number of other elements which currently provide resources for the target either through direct or indirect interactions, similar to 9 Components Intervention of the Four Point Process. The amount of separation between the target and the external 10 Porosity environment.

However, the properties on their own are useless if they cannot become quantifiable properties, objective, or understandable by the common person not necessarily involved in the security field. Therefore we still need to turn the trust properties into trust rules, calculations of directly relevant operations made from all the trust properties. We do this in the form of questions where the answers are unbiased numbers which will be used to create a percentage for easier comprehension and which matches our common use of qualifiers of trust in normal speech like almost, sometimes, always, and never. When creating the trust rules from the trust properties it is important to note that trust decisions are not linear. There is no building towards trust in a particular order or even an effort value system where it", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 72}}
