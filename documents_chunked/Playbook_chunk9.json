{"text": "to whitelisting. A blacklist is a list of everything not allowed to enter or connect to a particular system. A whitelist, on the other hand, is a list of the things you allow. By using blacklists, you can deny entire categories of devices, programs, or service types if they aren’t needed. Despite being weaker and easier to bypass than whitelists, blacklists are much easier to implement and maintain. This makes them practical as an additional form of separation. For example, most antivirus software utilizes a blacklist that enumerates known bad malware to search for in downloads and installs. SPAM controls work mostly with blacklists. Most firewalls and routers can employ blacklists to deny access from countries where they don’t do business. Specialized threat blacklists can also block known sites serving malware and launching attacks. Any of these can be employed as additional protection. Just keep in mind they can be shockingly easy for attackers to circumvent and therefore they should never be the main form of separation. THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 2: THE GAME PLAN 14 Apply Rehabilitation Tactics As is frequently the case in sports, outcomes in security are often determined by conditioning that took place far in advance. Athletes don’t show up to game day without putting in countless hours of practice first, and sporting franchises don’t invest in star athletes without first ensuring they have the trainers, doctors, and coaches necessary to support them and keep them performing at their best. Ask yourself: How rigorously has your security been tested? How many scenarios have you’ve prepared for? How quickly can you recover from setbacks and attacks? Security is equal parts preparation and resiliency. To achieve that, you need to adjust your game plan so it includes regularly revisiting steps for what to do when something goes wrong. Here are some rehabilitation tactics you should be sure to use: 1. Set up a means to back up and restore systems, data, mobile devices, and desktops. Backups should be centralized, secured, and ideally encrypted. If your backups are encrypted, both off-site (cloud) and internally stored back-ups are acceptable. Just remember, anything backed up outside your network is no longer in your control. Then again, if you cannot afford to properly build and test a backup system then you’re better off leaving control of such things to services that can. The key, however, is quick recovery, so test out restoring and make sure it happens quickly. 2. Have tools handy to fully copy a drive for forensics investigations and recovery. There are both hardware and software technologies that can do this, some of which are certified to use in criminal investigations. If you have cyber insurance for your network, you may be required to use specific forensic software to make a claim. 3. Keep shared data in central locations like a network access storage (NAS) server. That minimizes the amount of loss that occurs when a particular desktop fails.
