The final value will tell you how much you should trust the new employee. Re-evaluations can then be made regularly to see how much has changed and if this should influence any permissions provided to the employee, pay rate, or other bonuses.

This is determined with the use of the Trust Rules during security testing. Security management and policy creation is generally based on risk which defines the permissible interactions within and throughout an organization. This method essentially defines rules for users and configurations for systems which will provide the required level of protection when followed. The policy may also dictate how to handle problems which can occur should the rules or configurations be insufficient or not properly followed. Therefore the security policy will outline what the organization determines as trustworthy or not and which operational trusts will be allowed. However to test operational trust as established by the security policy is not security testing and it will not help an organization better determine where its protection is limited. Security testing against a particular policy to assure the rules are followed is called compliance testing and it is not the same as security testing. The use of the OSSTMM audit will determine the existing operational trusts whether or not they are acknowledged within the security policy. These findings subjected to trust analysis where the Trust Rules have been applied on people, systems, and processes will provide a precise measurement of where controls need to be. This can then be compared to the security policy to find the deficiencies that impact current protection measures as well as future security plans. Ultimately the Analyst would use trust metrics in place of risk analysis for a more accurate means of protecting a scope.

The posture is the culture, rules, norms, contracts, legislation, and policies defining the target. It ends with result comparisons to any alarms, alerts, reports, or access logs. This is a full-circle concept where the first step is to be aware of the operational requirements for interacting with the target, and the last step is the review of the records of the audit trail. For the Analyst, this is simply: you know what you need to do, you do it, and then you check what you have done. This methodology separates what needs to be done", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 76}}
