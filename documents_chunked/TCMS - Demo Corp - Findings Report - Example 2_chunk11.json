{"text": "can request user SPNs. Impact: High – Using SPNs, it is possible to retrieve sensitive account password hashes and crack them offline. Tools Used: Impacket, Hashcat References: Kerberoasting details: https://adsecurity.org/?p=2293 Group Managed Service Accounts Overview Evidence Figure 14: Cracked service accounts Remediation Use Group Managed Service Accounts (GMSA) for privileged services. GMSA accounts can be used to ensure passwords are long, complex, and change frequently. Where GMSA is not applicable, protect accounts by utilizing a password vaulting solution. TCMS recommends configuring alert logging on domain controllers for Windows event ID 4769 whenever requesting a Kerberos service ticket. These alerts are prone to high false-positive rates but are a supplementary detective control. Tailor a security information and event management tool (SIEM) to alert on excessive user SPN requests. Demo Corp BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL Page 26 of 38\\nFinding IPT-015: Security Misconfiguration – GPP Credentials (High) Description: Demo Corp utilized “cpasswords” in Group Policy Preference (GPP) which any domain user can query from a domain controller’s SYSVOL folder. Microsoft published the key to decrypt these passwords. Risk: Likelihood: High – Any authenticated user can obtain this information and decrypt the password with open source tools. Impact: High – An adversary can use these credentials to move laterally within the network. Tools Used: Metasploit References: NIST SP800-53 IA-5(1) - Authenticator Management Evidence Figure 15: Dumped GPP credentials Remediation Apply vendor patching. Do not use GPP cpasswords. Additionally, enabling authentication on the NFS share will protect the confidentiality of the stored information. Exporting authentication logs to a SIEM solution will give incident response teams insights to brute force login attempts. Demo Corp BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL Page 27 of 38\\nFinding IPT-016: Insufficient Authentication - VNC (High) Description: Demo Corp deployed 3 servers that permitted unauthenticated access via VNC Server. Risk: Likelihood: High – Discovering unauthenticated VNC servers is trivial and can be done with open-source tools. Impact: High – Attackers can control industrial devices, destroy data, or shut down systems. System: 10.x.x.x, 10.x.x.x, 10.x.x.x Tools Used: Nessus, VNC Viewer References: NIST SP800-53 IA-5(1) - Authenticator Management Evidence [image redacted] Figure 16: Access to system via VNC Remediation Enable authentication on the VNC Server. Demo Corp BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL Page 28 of 38\\nFinding IPT-017: Default Credentials on Web Services (High) Description: TCMS validated default credentials worked on multiple web applications within the Demo Corp environment. Risk: Likelihood: High – Credentials are published for these devices and an attackers first authentication attempt. Impact: High – Attackers can control devices, destroy data, or shut down systems. System: Default credentials were tested on a sample set of web applications, but suggests checking the following addresses at a minimum: [file removed] Tools Used: Manual Review References: NIST SP800-53 IA-5(1) - Authenticator Management Evidence Figure 17: Dell iDRAC access via default credentials Remediation Change default credentials or disable unused accounts.
