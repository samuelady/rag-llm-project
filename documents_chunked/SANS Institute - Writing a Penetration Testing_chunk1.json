Then in section 3, the paper provides the needed content each report normally has, what each of the contents is used for, and how this will help the target readers of the penetration testing report understand the content. Finally appendix A has a sample penetration testing report applying the approach described. The target reader for this paper is the technical penetration testers that need to enhance their capabilities in report writing. For the purpose of this paper, 2 servers have been configured and GPEN.KM will be the organization name. )*+,%\"&(!.$*&/01(2$*&/0342*0.-5%2( ( ( @ 2021 SANS Institute Author Retains Full Rights\\n! !

This may include: • In mission critical infrastructure the organization may need to make sure some key IT persons are available during the test in case some thing does wrong e.g. server crash. • In rapidly changing IT infrastructure, the changes need to be freeze in the penetration testing scope during the test to make sure that the testing is exactly assessing the current IT (the penetration testing scope). • Even though there is no 100% security, the report will show the risks in the penetration testing scope during this period of time any risks after this time may arise because of some changes in the IT infrastructure of changing in the configuration. Pen Tester needs to make sure that sufficient time is allotted in the project plan.
