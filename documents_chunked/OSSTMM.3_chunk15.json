{"text": "an Access. Each point of interaction reduces the security below 100%, where 100% represents a full separation. Therefore, the increase in porosity is the decrease in security and each pore is either a Visibility, Access, or Trust. Term Definition Police science places “opportunity” as one of the three elements which encourage theft, along with “benefit”, and “diminished risk”. Visibility is a means of calculating opportunity. It is each target’s asset known to exist Visibility within the scope. Unknown assets are only in danger of being discovered as opposed to being in danger of being targeted. Since security is the separation of a threat and an asset then the ability to interact with the asset directly is to access it. Access is calculated by the number of different places where the interaction can occur. Removing Access direct interaction with an asset will halve the number of ways it can be taken away. We measure trust as part of OpSec as each relationship that exists where the target accepts interaction freely from another target within the scope. While a trust may be a security hole, it is a common replacement for authentication and a means for evaluating relationships in a rational and Trust repeatable manner. Therefore, the use of trust metrics is encouraged which will allow for one to measure how valid a trust is by calculating the amount of reliability in the trust.

Controls are a means to influence the impact of threats and their effects when interaction is required. Just because you can’t directly control it doesn’t mean it can’t be controlled. Control the environment and you control everything in it. While there are many different names and types of operation controls, there are only 12 main categories which contain all possible controls. Two of the categories however, Identification, the verification of an existing identity, and Authorization, the granting of permissions from the rightful authority, cannot stand alone in an operational environment and instead, in operations, combine and are added to the Authentication control. This leaves OpSec with ten possible controls an Analyst will need to identify and understand. The reason why Identification and Authorization cannot be expressed operationally is because neither can be transferred. Identity exists as is and while the means of identification, as a process, is an operational aspect, the actual process is to verify a previously provided identity from another source or from the latest in a chain of sources. Even under circumstances where a government agency officially changes the identity of a person, they are still the same person from identifying marks to their DNA and only their documentation changes. Therefore, a security process can attempt to identify someone by verifying their identity but nothing in this case is granted or provided. There is no true “granting” of identity just as there can be no true “theft” of identity.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 15}}
