{"text": "necessary permissions are requested when they are really needed. - Review permissions required by the app. - Review permissions required by third-party libraries and SDKs. - Use privacy-friendly APIs provided by the platform as alternatives to permissions (e.g. use the Photo Picker API instead of the storage permission; when pairing a device with BLE don’t ask for location; if location is needed, ask for coarse location). - Avoid platform-signed permissions when possible. - Confirm permissions are requested contextually (e.g., accessing the camera when taking a photo) and not just at app startup. - E.g. list permissions requested at app startup vs later. - Trace APIs that require permission usage. If possible, trace when the app accesses protected resources (from the OS side), the same way that the Privacy Dashboard an android and the Privacy Report does on iOS. - Check if permissions are revoked when no longer needed.\\nMASVS-PRIVACY-2: The app prevents identification of the user. ● Anonymization and Pseudonymisation Measures Description: Ensure techniques like anonymisation and pseudonymisation are implemented to prevent user identification. - Stripping data of any direct identifiers, such as user ID or name, before server-side collection. - Manipulating data to break the linkage and prevent re-linkage to real-world identities. - Check for use of Private (Information) Retrieval protocols and OHTTP (Oblivious HTTP). ● Identifier Management Review Description: Avoid using identifiers that are unique, or probabilistically unique. Instead, opt for identifiers that can be reset, except for user safety purposes when there are no alternative methods available. If you use advertising IDs, make sure they are only used for advertising purposes. - Only use an advertising ID for user profiling or ad-serving use cases. - For non-ad-serving use cases, use a privately stored globally-unique ID (GUID), which is app-scoped. - Check for identifiers generated using device or network data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a device. - Use the secure settings Android ID (SSAID) to share state between the apps that you own without requiring the user to sign in to an account (Android). MASVS-PRIVACY-3: The app is transparent about data collection and usage. ● Consent Management and User Awareness Description: Obtain explicit user consent before accessing sensors or local data. - Check for informative notifications or prompts. - Review purpose strings explaining data access needs. ● Data Collection and Sharing Description: Ensure sensitive data isn't shared with third parties unless necessary and users are informed both from the app and third-party code. - Ensure adherence to platform guidelines on data declarations. - Review data sent to app servers. - Review data sent to trackers. - Prevent data exchange between apps unless explicitly specified or chosen by the user. - Ensure local data processing mechanisms are prioritized (e.g. iOS on-device processing or Android On-Device Machine Learning and Private Compute Services). - Provide the user with a list of each third party with whom information about the user is shared, identify the categories of data shared with each third party, and provide links to those parties.\\n● Privacy Policy", "metadata": {"doc_id": "MASVS-PRIVACY", "chunk_id": 3}}
