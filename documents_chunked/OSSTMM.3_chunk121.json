(e) Verify the control and response of the target to mail bounces where the FROM is spoofed in the header field to be that of the target domain. 11.6.3 Resource Abuse (a) Test the depth of access to business or confidential information available on web servers without any established, required credentials. (b) Test if information is sent to the outside of the scope as padding to network packets such as that which has occurred previously as “Etherleak”. (c) Verify that continuity measures, specifically load balancing, are seamless outside the scope to prevent users from using, referring, linking, bookmarking, or abusing just one of the resources.

(b) Document the depth of the recorded interaction and the process of identification. (c) Verify that all methods of interactions are properly recorded with proper identification. (d) Identify methods of identification which defeat repudiation. 11.7.2 Confidentiality (a) Enumerate all interactions with services within the scope for communications or assets transported over the channel using secured lines, encryption, “quieted” or “closed” interactions to protect the confidentiality of the information property between the involved parties. (b) Verify the acceptable methods used for confidentiality. (c) Test the strength and design of the encryption or obfuscation method. (d) Verify the outer limits of communication which can be protected via the applied methods of confidentiality. 11.7.3 Privacy (a) Enumerate services within the scope for communications or assets transported using specific, individual signatures, personal identification, “quieted” or “closed room” personal interactions to protect the privacy of the interaction and the process of providing assets only to those within the proper security clearance for that process, communication, or asset. (b) Correlate information with non-responsive TCP and UDP ports to determine if availability is dependent upon a private type of contact or protocol. 11.7.4 Integrity Enumerate and test for inadequacies of integrity where using a documented process, signatures, encryption, hash, or markings to assure that the asset cannot be changed, redirected, or reversed without it being known to the parties involved.

(b) Verify the appropriateness and functionality of incident response and forensics capabilities for all types of systems. (c) Verify the level of incident or compromise which the support channels can detect and the length of response time. 11.8.2 Misinformation Determine the extent to", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 121}}
