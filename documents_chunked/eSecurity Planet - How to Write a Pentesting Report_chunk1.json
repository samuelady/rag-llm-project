However, the usability of the report depends on a writer’s ability to take the unique information and organize it into an expected format clearly and concisely. Some components of a pen test will be mandatory and must be present to provide value. Other components are nice to have because they help to improve the value of the report to stakeholders. The table below lists key information on eight common sections found in a typical pentest report, which we’ll go into in more detail below.

They may know they have a network, but not und×erstand how firewall rules protect that network. An executive summary must be simple, written in non-technical English, and to the point. The pentest writer must outline the key findings and high-level recommendations based on urgency and risk in a clear manner. https://www.esecurityplanet.com/networks/pentest-report/ 2/11\\nThe executive summary contains similar sections as the rest of the report, but in summary form: key findings, engagement summary, and overall penetration test results. Where possible, tables, charts, and graphics should be used to help quickly convey the findings by severity rating, items to address immediately, etc. The executive summary will generally be placed first in the pen test report, but written last once all of the other findings have been compiled and drafted. This is perhaps the most critical section of the report since the non-technical executives will likely determine future budgets for vulnerability correction and pentesting needs. Key Findings As this is the most important section for the technical team, it is placed as the second major section of the report. For every unique vulnerability identified, the pen test report writer will create a vulnerability report. All major vulnerabilities will be listed and detailed within the key findings section, with backup information that explains: Vulnerability name, standardized if possible Location of the vulnerability (list of systems, apps, etc.) Technique used to find the vulnerability Proof of", "metadata": {"doc_id": "eSecurity Planet - How to Write a Pentesting Report", "chunk_id": 1}}
