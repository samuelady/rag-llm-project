This channel covers the interaction of the Analyst with the targets. While some services consider this simply as “phreaking”, the true compliance objective of security testing in this channel is logical barrier testing and gap measurement against the required security standard as outlined in company policy, industry regulations, or regional legislation. The Analyst will be required to have multiple tools and methods for the completion of some tasks to assure that suspicion is not raised among personnel by continual and sequential ringing of phones and that tests are not made invalid due to an early discovery or heightened paranoia. Analysts will also need to be prepared for working with both digital and analog telecommunications equipment, sound frequency analyzers, and within information networks providing regional content through local phone providers. Competent Analysts will require an electronics background in both analog and digital telephony and critical thinking skills to assure factual data collection creates factual results through correlation and analysis. Considerations Please note the following considerations to assure a safe, high quality test: 1. Ignorantia legis neminem excusat: Analysts who do not do proper posture review for the scope as well as the regions targeted for business or interactions may not escape punishment for violating laws merely because they were unaware of the law; that is, persons have presumed knowledge of the law. Analysts are considered professionals in this subject matter and, therefore, the assumption exists that even what may not be common knowledge for a normal person about a foreign region’s laws regarding computer systems, will be known by professionals as they are aware of the laws necessary to engage in their undertakings. 2. Property rights: Testing must specifically target only systems which are under direct legal ownership of the scope owner or computer systems on the property of the scope owner. Such property or personal effects should remain personal and private unless it specifically involves the scope owner through disparagement, false light, competitiveness, or reasons stated in personnel contract agreements. Analysts must make efforts to not invade", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 106}}
