In this case, all external IPs used for the DMZ and web tier were included in the scope. This would include all systems that directly store, process, or transmit cardholder data. Because the Client has full control and full responsibility for its security, the DNS server was included in the scope of the test to determine whether an attacker could compromise the server and redirect traffic intended for the Client’s sites to a malicious intermediary or fraudulent site. The image CDN servers were determined out of scope because no PAN data is transmitted or processed and the systems are otherwise fully segmented. The staging systems are unavailable from the Internet and therefore cannot be tested. The web applications for Brand A and Brand B will be completely in scope. The web application for Brand C is presumed to be an exact copy, exclusive of product information and look and feel. The tester will sample the web application for Brand C to verify that the applications are the same as Brand B. If it is determined that there are material differences between Brand B and Brand C web applications, Brand C will be brought fully into scope. The Client and Pen Test Company have agreed that testing will be conducted against the production systems, as no suitable staging or review system is publicly available. Because of this limitation, testing must be performed with the intrusion prevention system enabled. However, because the timeline for testing cannot accommodate the time required to use techniques that might bypass the IPS, the Client has agreed to remove any blocks enabled by the system during testing. For this engagement the Client has requested that additional rules of engagement include that testing be limited to non-peak hours, and any attempts to run exploit code on the remote systems be performed only after notifying the Client. Also, any accounts created by the tester or successful orders placed in the system must be identified at the end of each day’s testing. All parties have agreed that no further testing is required if the penetration tester is able to extract data from either of the databases or obtain shell access on any server in the web farm. Engagement Phase (Discovery and Attack/Execution) The penetration tester began by comparing the scope provided by the Client with the latest ASV report to ensure they agreed on the assets and targets under examination. Any differences in scope were noted and investigated. The penetration tester then gathered information on the target organization through web sites and mail servers, public records, and databases.
