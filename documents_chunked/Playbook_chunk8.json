Create zones in your desktops, servers, and mobile devices that separate what can execute and what can read/write. This allows for temp files to be created while denying temp files from executing in the case of malware. On desktops and mobile devices, whitelist specifically which applications may execute or use the network and deny the rest. Furthermore, exercise the principle of least privilege to ensure users don’t get administrative or elevated privileges by default. THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 2: THE GAME PLAN 13 8. Keep work and personal mobile devices separate. Apps have notoriously bad security, and each app on your mobile device is connected to every other app on that device. That makes the concept of zoning incredibly important. If your business requires the use of mobile devices then separate which can have personal apps and which can have work apps. There is technology to separate work and personal data on one physical device if you don’t want to carry two devices. 9. Create zones by using multiple web browsers to deal with web attacks. For example, you can keep one browser clean with no plug-ins and use it specifically for banking, vendor administration, and other critically confidential connections. Use another browser for online shopping. Use another browser for reading the news, surfing, and social networks (note: Do use ad blockers and privacy plug-ins on the browser for surfing to minimize exposure to malicious ads that force downloads of malware). You can also use a single browser with multiple profiles, however some browsers require a particular profile to be closed while another is open, and that can be a hassle. 10. Zone your remote interactions. That means any remote access to your office, interactions with cloud services, administrating vendor accounts over the web, or sending emails. Your best protection for remote interactions is encryption. Use an encrypted VPN if the place you’re sending or receiving from is not your place of work. Because emails are plain text and can be read along the route from one place to another you should use email encryption anytime you’re emailing between remote offices or sending sensitive information. 11. Use work times as part of your zoning. Shut down systems, routers, and wi-fi access points you don’t need to keep running at the end of the day, weekends, and holidays. If you can’t have staff support incident response for these things and be there to deal with emergencies then they should not be connected to the Internet during those times. 12. Use blacklists if you can’t whitelist or as an addition to whitelisting. A blacklist is a list of everything not allowed to enter or connect to a particular system. A whitelist, on the other hand, is a list of the things you allow. By using blacklists, you can deny entire categories of devices, programs, or service types if they aren’t", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Playbook", "chunk_id": 8}}
