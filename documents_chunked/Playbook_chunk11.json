{"text": "and contend with a network of systems you know better than anyone else. Here’s how to make the most of your home field advantages: 1. Know what’s happening on your network. This is probably your greatest home field advantage. To monitor your network for activity and have a clear picture of what’s running at any time of day there are several technologies you can look into. Security information and event management (SIEM) products will consolidate log files from all your systems and real-time captures of network traffic. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), which are generally a blacklist technology, will monitor real-time network traffic and respond to some types of attacks. Even without these technologies, however, tools like tcpdump and Wireshark will you give you more than enough information to understand what’s running on your network and where it’s going. That will help you at least see if your zone defense is working. As a network grows, you may want to look into behavioral analysis network tools to help automate sniffing out anomalies, because not all malicious activity is obvious. THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 2: THE GAME PLAN 17 2. Know what should be on each default install of each hard drive, whether it’s a desktop or a server. This allows you to recognize malware or non-standard software installs. If you prefer to use file integrity software you will be alerted to changes in various files and directories that can indicate malware or compromise. Integrity checking is most powerful on servers where it can immediately replace files placed by attackers. 3. Change default settings. Your protocols are not just the types of packets that run on your network, but how you configure them to run. The attacker needs to learn what you’re running, how it’s connected to the rest of the network, and how it responds. By changing the default install and directory names, default logins and passwords on systems and devices, and default configurations such as the service ports of network devices and servers you can protect yourself from bot attacks which look for defaults. Simply moving the administrative port of SSH to a random, high number will keep it discreetly out of obvious reach while your network monitoring tools will notice a port scan and give you a chance to stop it. 4. Change how your servers respond to queries. Attackers who footprint your network for a targeted attack will primarily be looking for what kinds of systems and applications you have. Changing how your servers respond to queries so that there are only positives and false positives will flood common attack tools with noise so they cannot tell if the tool’s replies are true. For example, something as simple as changing your web servers to respond to every request with a 200 even if it’s not found or moved (error codes 404 and 302, respectively) can render common, automated web scraping and analysis tools mostly useless. You can tune your TCP responses also so every port queried responds", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Playbook", "chunk_id": 11}}
