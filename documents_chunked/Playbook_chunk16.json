{"text": "something important despite meaning nothing than it is to choose and implement tactics that work. You look better longer, too, because whereas a cybersecurity strategy can go on meaning nothing a really long time tactics that mean nothing get noticed right away. Cybersecurity tactics, meanwhile, are where the rubber meets the road. They are the bat striking the ball. They are literally the packets smacking the server. They are the way you “do the thing you do to the things you have” to achieve cybersecurity. And that’s hard to plan out. That said, here are a few steps to point you in the right direction: \u0001 Draw out the interactions and the separations between your systems. \u0001 This should be based on the packet activity you find on the network. It’s like making a hybrid physical and logical network map with arrows of interactions based on protocol activity. Determine how anything that should be separated or controlled. Voila, that’s you applying tactics! \u0001 List all of your network processes. \u0001 This includes server backups, server administration, remote desktop support services, etc. Know exactly what systems and people they can interact with, then determine what they should be interacting with. How you control that authorization is you applying tactics. \u0001 Do the same for wireless, physical room and asset access, and telephone systems. \u0001 Determine which tactics you need to apply to assure control. \u0001 Now take a step back. \u0001 Make sure that all of the tactics you chose fit with the overall company strategy and resources and that workflow is not hampered.

The majority of us like being liked, like belonging to a group or a team, like standing up for a cause, and like being part of a community. Or even if we don’t “like” it doesn’t mean we want to be pushed out of it, either. The problem is just because we like it doesn’t mean we’re good at it. A lack of communication with the people holding the resources will greatly affect your ability to build the security that’s needed. Here are some tips for making communication run smoother: \u0001 Don’t assume because it makes sense to you that it makes sense to everyone. \u0001 It’s normal for people not to like change. Therefore you need to consider this hurdle anytime you’re proposing change and prepare for it by showing that change is the new normal. After all, the criminal hackers entering organizations like yours have had plenty of success, and they change tools and techniques all the time. \u0001 Communicate with your coworkers or your boss according to their capabilities. \u0001 If they are tech savvy, don’t talk down to them. If they aren’t technical, don’t go to them with tech-heavy reasoning. \u0001 Think about the money before you talk. \u0001 Your company is in business to make money. Show value. Provide ways to show that", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Playbook", "chunk_id": 16}}
