This project applies ravs and Trust Metrics to determining security maturity by how well protection strategy and tactics work and not just how they should work according to policy. http://www.isecom.org/soma Business Integrity Testing (BIT) The BIT project extends the OSSTMM operational testing and analysis to business processes and transactions. This adds new strategic insight to the security of business conduct by employees and in the development of new business plans. http://www.isecom.org/bit Smarter Safer Better This project provides the safety and security tools and skills people need every day to combat fraud, lies, and deception. The tools are based on the OSSTMM research which is focused on avoiding persuasive tricks and manipulation techniques. The project is unique in how it utilizes support groups for people to discuss issues they have encountered and work together to analyze the problems. http://www.smartersaferbetter.org Mastering Trust This project is to create seminar materials and workbooks on how to use the OSSTMM Trust Metrics in every day life to make better decisions. This project addresses why our gut instincts are broken and how we can fix and improve them. Whether its in business or private relationships, knowing who you can trust and how much is more than protecting yourself from being hurt, it ́s a competitive edge. http://www.isecom.org/seminars Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution-Non-Commercial-NoDerivs 2010, ISECOM, www.isecom.org, www.osstmm.org 18\\nSecurity doesn’t have to last forever; just longer than everything else that might notice it’s gone.

It is about measuring how well security works. While this may seem plain and obvious: “Don’t we all do operational security?” it is a distinction which must be made because most compliance objectives require no more than matching processes and configurations to a set of best practices. This manual and the testing process it outlines requires that you make no assumptions that a security solution, product, or process will behave during operational use as it has been designated to do on paper. More simply, this methodology will tell you if what you have does what you want it to do and not just what it was told to do. OpSec is a combination of separation and controls. Under OpSec, for a threat to be effective, it must interact either directly or indirectly with the asset. To separate the threat from the asset is to avoid a possible interaction. Therefore it is possible to have total (100%) security if the threat and the asset are completely separated from each other. Otherwise what you have is safety of the asset which is provided by the controls you put on the asset or the degree to which you lessen the impact", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 11}}
