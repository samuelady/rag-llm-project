{"text": "a problem affecting all industries but none so obviously as security which is why critical security thinking is so important. As a technique for analysis it can be reduced to 6 simple steps to ascertain factual results with a high trust level for correctness even when solutions are not linear like when there is no connection from point A to point B. Therefore the ability to validate sources and measure trust is crucial for making proper, actionable intelligence out of tests. In these steps, “target” refers to whatever you are analyzing in preparation of a test, be it people, computers, buildings, or processes. 1. Build your knowledge of the target from a variety of the most contemporary, factual resources while avoiding commercially biased and speculative information. 2. Determine the global level of experience for the type of target and the amount of information possibly known about it. 3. Determine any bias or ulterior motives in the information sources. 4. Translate jargon from information sources to similar or known words for comparison because what may sound new or complicated may just be a trick to differentiate something common. 5. Be sure the test equipment has been properly calibrated and the test environment verified to assure the results are not contaminated by the test itself. 6. Assure that the translation state of tools or test processes has been removed as much as possible so that the results do not come from the indirect sources in a process or the pre-analysis from some tools. What’s most important to understand here is when making a characterization don’t worry about being right. It’s more important to be right about being wrong or right which means the right tests were made to verify the characterization. Then if the characterization is wrong we at least know for sure it is wrong and can re-characterize. That’s how the scientific method works. It’s not about believing or relying on your experience, no matter how vast, but on knowing facts we can build upon.

Understanding our own limitations as humans and how we think influences how security can be perceived and defined. This leads many security professionals to provide qualifiers for what they don’t understand or can’t deliver. Most often though they are just repeated as axioms without further thought, eventually accepted as truths of security. This further hurts our ability to provide proper security because our analysis is perverted by catch phrases and best practices that may have no basis in fact now or ever. For example, some common axioms still in use will seem much less like golden rules and more like excuses when put to the light of critical security thing. These axioms are so common because there is a general inability to think critically about security or separate", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 42}}
