TCM Security confirmed that the vulnerability likely exists but did not attempt the exploit to prevent any denial of service. Risk: Likelihood: High – Malicious actors have used SMB exploitations like EternalBlue in recent breaches. Impact: Very High – If exploited, an attacker gains code execution as the system user. An adversary will require additional techniques to obtain domain administrator access.

Retrieving these user SPNs permitted TCMS to crack 4 account passwords. No service accounts were observed running as domain administrators. User accounts were observed running as a service, which is not best practice. Risk: Likelihood: High – Any account joined to the domain can request user SPNs. Impact: High – Using SPNs, it is possible to retrieve sensitive account password hashes and crack them offline.
