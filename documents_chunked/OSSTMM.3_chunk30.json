The Analyst must respect the privacy of all individuals and maintain their privacy for all results. 32. Results involving people untrained in security or non-security personnel may only be reported via non-identifying or statistical means. 33. The Analyst may not sign test results and audit reports in which they were not directly involved. 34. Reports must remain objective and without untruths or any personally directed malice. 35. Client notifications are required whenever the Analyst changes the testing plan, changes the source test venue, has low trust findings, or any testing problems have occurred. Notifications must be provided previous to running new, dangerous, or high traffic tests, and regular progress updates are required. 36. Where solutions and recommendations are included in the report, they must be valid and practical. 37. Reports must clearly mark all unknowns and anomalies. 38. Reports must clearly state both discovered successful and failed security measures and loss controls. 39. Reports must use only quantitative metrics for measuring security. These metrics must be based on facts and void of subjective interpretations. 40. The client must be notified when the report is being sent as to expect its arrival and to confirm receipt of delivery. 41.

Unfortunately, not everything works as configured. Not everyone behaves as trained. Therefore the truth of configuration and training is in the resulting operations. Thatâ€™s why we need to test operations. The OpSec testing process is a discrete event test of a dynamic, stochastic system. This means that you will be making a chronological sequence of tests on a system that changes and does not always give the same output for the input provided. The target is a system, a collection of interacting and co-dependent processes which is also influenced by the stochastic environment it exists in. Being stochastic means the behavior of events in a system cannot be determined because the next environmental state can only be partially but not fully determined by the previous state. The system contains a finite but possibly extremely large number of variables and each change in variables may present an event and a change in state. Since the environment is stochastic, there is an element of randomness and there is no means", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 30}}
