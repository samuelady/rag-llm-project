Unfortunately, many illogical trust properties exist and are all too commonly in use which makes it more difficult for us to make proper trust decisions without it feeling wrong. However, it’s exactly the feeling part which makes us more error prone. During research, many potential trust properties were discovered which are commonly in use and even official, government and industry regulations recommend, however they failed logic tests and were discarded from our set of properties leaving only ten.

Many illogical methods for trust exist and are popularly used. Two examples of the most common, fallacious, trust properties are composability and transitivity. These properties are popularly used by people to make trust decisions about the unknown. In composability, a person makes a trust choice based on what a large number of people have to say about the thing or person in question even if those people aren’t individually trusted. Basically, a person accepts the group’s trusts as their own. This is similar to the pressure created by social or political groups and mass media. The reason why this is illogical is because the individual experiences of others, especially strangers, are all relative and cannot verify the consistent trustworthiness of future events. Common examples of fallacious trust use, first with Composability and secondly, with Transitivity. The other common fallacious use of trust is transitivity. It is when a person accepts the trust decision of a trusted person for themselves. It is also known as the chain of trust: you trust Alice and Alice trusts Jack therefore you can trust Jack. However, transitive trust is illogical as well because you may trust Alice for some things but perhaps not the same things for which she trusts Jack. There is also the possibility that Alice has approached the trust for some emotional benefit not available to you. People who often trust “their gut” to make trust decisions are lauded when they are right as if they have some secret, powerful sense above other humans. However, other than just luck, some people are better at paying attention to details, seeing emotional micro-expressions in faces, and applying logic quickly to common situations which they themselves might not be able to express verbally as to how but rather they do feel what’s wrong. These people learned to do this naturally and built upon it with experience filled with trial and error not really obvious to themselves any more than anyone notices the millions of small decisions they make each day and their consequences. The trust properties allow ordinary people who do not have this natural ability to analyze any of their trust decisions with skill, distancing themselves from their own under-developed “gut instinct” until they can recondition themselves to do", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 71}}
