Analysts are considered professionals in this subject matter and, therefore, the assumption exists that what may not be common knowledge for a normal person about a foreign region’s laws regarding computer systems, professionals make themselves aware of the laws necessary to engage in that undertaking. 2. Property rights: Testing must specifically target only systems which are under direct legal ownership with the scope owner and computer systems on the property of the scope owner. Any personal effect should remain personal and private unless it specifically involves the scope owner through disparagement, false light, competitiveness, or reasons stated in personnel contract agreements. Analysts must make efforts to not invade upon a person’s private life where that private life has made efforts to separate itself from the scope. Analysts with special agreements to test systems which are under direct contract but not owned or are owned but not housed at the owner’s legal property must take great caution to assure tests have minimum impact on other systems and tertiary parties outside the scope or contract.

This review forms a matrix against which testing should be mapped but not constrained due to the ubiquity of the channel endpoints. Therefore, it is important to consider, as some legislation requires, the target market or end users of this channel which must also be added to the scope for this module. 11.1.1 Policy Review and document appropriate organizational policy regarding security, integrity, and privacy requirements of the scope. Review and document contracts and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with service providers and other involved third parties. 11.1.2 Legislation and Regulations Review and document appropriate regional and national legislation, and industry regulations regarding the security and privacy requirements of the organization in the scope as well as that which includes the appropriate customers, partners, organizational branches, or resellers outside the scope. 11.1.3 Culture Review and document appropriate organizational culture in the scope towards security and privacy awareness, required and available personnel training, organizational hierarchy, help desk use, and requirements for reporting security issues. 11.1.4 Age Review and document the age of systems, software, and service applications required for operations. 11.1.5 Fragile Artifacts Review and document any systems, software, and service applications which require special care due to high use, instabilities, or a high rate of change.
