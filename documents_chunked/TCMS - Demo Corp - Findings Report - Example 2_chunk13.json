Suggested mitigations include: • Disabling IPMI over LAN if it is not needed. • Using strong passwords to limit the successfulness of off-line dictionary attacks. • Using Access Control Lists (ACLs) or isolated networks to limit access to your IPMI management interfaces. Demo Corp BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL Page 33 of 38\\nFinding IPT-022: Insufficient SNMP Community String Complexity (Moderate) Description: Demo Corp deployed SNMP with default “public” community strings. This configuration exposed read-only access to the system’s management information base (MIB), including the network configurations. Risk: Likelihood: High – Basic network scans will identify this vulnerability. Impact: Moderate – If exploited, an attacker can profile the device and focus attacks.

Telnet uses plain text authentication and passes all data (including passwords) in clear text and can be intercepted by an attacker. Risk: Likelihood: Low – An adversary requires a Man-in-the-Middle position between the client and server. Impact: High – If exploited an adversary may intercept administrative credentials that can be used in other attacks. System: Identified 53 machines, please see the below file for listing.

Demo Corp BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL Page 35 of 38\\nFinding IPT-024: Insufficient Terminal Services Configuration (Moderate) Description: The remote Terminal Services is not configured to use Network Level Authentication (NLA) only. NLA uses the Credential Security Support Provider (CredSSP) protocol to perform strong server authentication either through TLS/SSL or Kerberos mechanisms, which protect against man-in-the-middle attacks. In addition to improving authentication, NLA also helps protect the remote computer from malicious users and software by completing user authentication before a full RDP connection is established. Risk: Likelihood: Low – An attacker can discover these vulnerabilities with basic tools.
