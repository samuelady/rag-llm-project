{"text": "the 'supply chain' of SDKs they incorporate, ensuring that no data is unnecessarily passed down their chain of dependencies. This end-to-end responsibility for data aligns with recent SBOM regulatory requirements, making apps more accountable for their data practices. MASVS-PRIVACY-2 The app prevents identification of the user. Protecting user identity is crucial. This control emphasizes the use of unlinkability techniques like data abstraction, anonymization and pseudonymization to prevent user identification and tracking. Another key aspect addressed by this control is to establish technical barriers when employing complex 'fingerprint-like' signals (e.g. device IDs, IP addresses, behavioral patterns) for specific purposes. For instance, a fingerprint used for fraud detection should be isolated and not repurposed for audience measurement in an analytics SDK. This ensures that each data stream serves its intended function without risking user privacy.\\nMASVS-PRIVACY-3 The app is transparent about data collection and usage. Users have the right to know how their data is being used. This control ensures that apps provide clear information about data collection, storage, and sharing practices, including any behavior a user wouldn't reasonably expect, such as background data collection. Apps should also adhere to platform guidelines on data declarations. MASVS-PRIVACY-4 The app offers user control over their data. Users should have control over their data. This control ensures that apps provide mechanisms for users to manage, delete, and modify their data, and change privacy settings as needed (e.g. to revoke consent). Additionally, apps should re-prompt for consent and update their transparency disclosures when they require more data than initially specified.\\nTests In privacy testing, much like with security, the specific context and use case play a big role. While some tests might not show an outright violation, they're designed to provide clear and relevant evidence. This ensures that a reviewer can make a well-informed decision about potential issues. A prerequisite for privacy testing with the MASTG, is to clearly identify data considered sensitive in the context of the mobile app and to understand how both the first-party and any third-party partners utilize each type of data. For instance, if your app gathers an email address for user authentication and to tailor their experience, that touches on both App Functionality and Product Personalization. To get a clearer picture of these nuances, it's a good idea to refer to resources like Apple's App Privacy Details and Google Play's Data Usage Guidelines. MASVS-PRIVACY-1: The app minimizes access to sensitive data and resources. ● Validate Data Access Scope Description: Ensure the app only accesses data essential for its functionality. - Ensure metadata with data protection relevance is removed when using device sensors (e.g. camera, microphone). - Erase personal data as soon as its purpose is fulfilled. ● Permission Management Description: Ensure only necessary permissions are requested when they are really needed. - Review permissions required by the app. - Review permissions required by third-party libraries and SDKs. - Use privacy-friendly APIs provided by the platform as alternatives to permissions (e.g. use the Photo Picker API instead of the storage permission; when pairing", "metadata": {"doc_id": "MASVS-PRIVACY", "chunk_id": 2}}
