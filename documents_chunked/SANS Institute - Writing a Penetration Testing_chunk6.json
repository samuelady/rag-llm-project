Providing the assumption will help the report audiences to understand why penetration testing followed a specific direction. Timeline This will show the penetration testing start and end dates. This will provide the report target audiences with information about: 1- Testing duration 2- The tested IP address's risks, from pen-testing point of view, during this period only. 3- The pen-tester does not hold any responsibilities if some risk aroused after this period of time due to some changes in the target systems. )*+,%\"&(!.$*&/01(2$*&/0342*0.-5%2( ( ( @ 2021 SANS Institute Author Retains Full Rights\\n! !

Present the findings in the simplest way as possible. For each finding describe the threat level, vulnerability rating, analysis of the issue and the impact on the information asset (the IP address) if the threat agent was able to exploit the vulnerability, Risk Rating and Recommendation. Each one of these elements will be briefed in the next paragraphs. There are a number of ways in which results can be presented. Here are a few: • Tables • Graphs • Pie or Bar charts • Diagrams Vulnerabilities For each piece of vulnerability, a clear description should be shown about the source of the vulnerability, its impact and the likelihoods of the vulnerability to be exploited.
