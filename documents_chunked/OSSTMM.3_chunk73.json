{"text": "qualifiers of trust in normal speech like almost, sometimes, always, and never. When creating the trust rules from the trust properties it is important to note that trust decisions are not linear. There is no building towards trust in a particular order or even an effort value system where it can be determined that one level requires more effort than another. In methodology terms, it appears irrational when calculated. A decision to trust therefore may be concluded by an answer from just one of the following tests which makes up the trust rules. However, doing so is our conscious choice to make a trust where the calculation specifically says not to. This may make most sense in a life or death situation where the result of trustworthiness is very low but the Value of Reward (one’s life) is so incredibly great that no other choice can be made. The trust rules must be created specifically for the target. While this may seem cumbersome, it is possible to make generically topic-specific trust rules which will suit the purpose. The benefit of this is that the trust properties can then be made into rules fitting any purpose and any situation where one must make a trust decision on another person, thing, process, system, or action. With practice, these trust rules can be made automatically and very quickly as part of one’s decision process, focusing only on the rules which can be answered and discovering the ones where there can be no known answer with the information available. The application of the trust rules into specific verification tests that provide a quantity is good however ideally you need to determine a finite quantity. An infinite quantity may be too relative to the tester and does not provide the constraints necessary for expressing the result in a percentage. For example, to apply the third property, transparency, the components should be counted as indexed so that there is a finite amount. So the parts of a computer can have an end number before the computer is completely built and a process can have a precise, finite number of steps before it is completed. For people, however, this may not be so easy to do but it is possible if applied properly to the situation. In the case of a security clearance, you may count all relationships within a given time range and of those, the number which are with people who have criminal records. This allows for a finite number even if rather large. Then, you may want to complete other tests specific to the third rule as that one may only give one type of influence. Others may be financial necessities, work experiences, memberships, convictions, and anything that will give a good representation as to how transparent that person is. The final calculation however has to be the sum total of all tests which will provide a single transparency percentage for that rule. The resulting percentage for each trust rule can be viewed individually", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 73}}
