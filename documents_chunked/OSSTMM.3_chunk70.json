{"text": "improper or incomplete operational controls with their trusts like authentication that has been made with improper identification such as a voice over a telephone, a business card, or even just the assumption that because a person is in the room that they are authorized to be there. This opens people up to fraud and deceit. The use of additional controls are required to secure a trust, to assure its integrity and resilience. Unfortunately, while using more controls works with objects and processes, it may not work between people. Many times social norms consider controls beyond simple authentication like matching a face or Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution-Non-Commercial-NoDerivs 2010, ISECOM, www.isecom.org, www.osstmm.org 87\\nvoice with an identity to be offensive to the person to be trusted. Society often requires us to be more trusting as individuals in order to benefit society as a whole and sometimes at the expense of everyone’s individual protection. As stated earlier, operational trust is measured as a negative thing which comes from an interaction between two entities in a scope. When a trust has no controls, it’s what people call “blind trust” which may be good for relationships and can speed interactions but is bad for operational security. People generally apply controls to trusts even if they don’t think of it as such at the time. Some controls are inherently given more weight than others depending on the situation and need. When selecting a person who they need to depend on, they may put a larger value on integrity and resilience. When making a financial transaction, they may put a larger value on authentication, continuity, and confidentiality. They may put a larger value on alarm and subjugation for advice on a product unless it’s a medical prescription then they would prefer privacy and non-repudiation. Realistically though, they are not actually giving more value to particular controls. Instead they are actually evaluating on the ten trust properties and looking for those specific controls for comfort to their trust decisions. Using the trust properties allows them to make a decision to trust or not even when the information they have about the target is incomplete. Since uninformed and unpracticed trust decision making is a dangerous gamble the very least a formal process like applying the trust properties can provide is to inform the decision maker of exactly how much they don’t know and allow them to seek more information before continuing. This means that the real need for being able to quantify operational trust occurs when we must rely on many unknowns to determine and rationalize trust. The trust properties are the quantifiable, objective elements which are used to create trust. We can say these properties are what we would say give us “reason to trust”. These properties are to be made into baseline rules based on the target and situation which we are verifying. Unfortunately, many illogical trust properties exist and are all too commonly in use which makes it more difficult for us to make proper trust decisions", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 70}}
