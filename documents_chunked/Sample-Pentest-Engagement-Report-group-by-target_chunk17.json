Exploit N/A Risk level Medium CVSS 6.8 CVE CVE-2022-24735 Summary Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. By exploiting weaknesses in the Lua script execution environment, an attacker with access to Redis prior to version 7.0.0 or 6.2.7 can inject Lua code that will execute with the (potentially higher) privileges of another Redis user. The Lua script execution environment in Redis provides some measures that prevent a script from creating side effects that persist and can affect the execution of the same, or different script, at a later time. Several weaknesses of these measures have been publicly known for a long time, but they had no security impact as the Redis security model did not endorse the concept of users or privileges. With the introduction of ACLs in Redis 6.0, these weaknesses can be exploited by a less 77\\nprivileged users to inject Lua code that will execute at a later time, when a privileged user executes a Lua script. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 7.0.0 and 6.2.7. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable, if Lua scripting is not being used, is to block access to `SCRIPT LOAD` and `EVAL` commands using ACL rules. Exploit N/A Risk level Medium CVSS 6.5 CVE CVE-2021-32626 Summary Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. In affected versions specially crafted Lua scripts executing in Redis can cause the heap- based Lua stack to be overflowed, due to incomplete checks for this condition. This can result with heap corruption and potentially remote code execution. This problem exists in all versions of Redis with Lua scripting support, starting from 2.6. The problem is fixed in versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14. For users unable to update an additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from executing Lua scripts. This can be done using ACL to restrict EVAL and EVALSHA commands. Exploit N/A Risk level Medium 78\\nCVSS 6.5 CVE CVE-2023-25155 Summary Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. Authenticated users issuing specially crafted `SRANDMEMBER`, `ZRANDMEMBER`, and `HRANDFIELD` commands can trigger an integer overflow, resulting in a runtime assertion and termination of the Redis server process. This problem affects all Redis versions. Patches were released in Redis version(s) 6.0.18, 6.2.11 and 7.0.9. Exploit N/A Risk level Medium CVSS 6.5 CVE CVE-2023-28856 Summary Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. Authenticated users can use the `HINCRBYFLOAT` command to create an invalid hash field that will crash Redis on access in affected versions. This issue has been addressed in in versions 7.0.11, 6.2.12, and 6.0.19. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
