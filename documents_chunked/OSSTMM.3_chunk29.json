The scope must be clearly defined contractually before verifying vulnerable services. 18. The audit must clearly explain the limits of any security tests according to the scope. E. Test Plan 19. The test plan may not contain plans, processes, techniques, or procedures which are outside the area of expertise or competence level of the Analyst. F. Test Process 20. The Analyst must respect and maintain the safety, health, welfare, and privacy of the public both within and outside the scope. 21. The Analyst must always operate within the law of the physical location(s) of the targets in addition to rules or laws governing the Analyst’s test location. 22. To prevent temporary raises in security for the duration of the test, only notify key people about the testing. It is the client’s judgment which discerns who the key people are; however, it is assumed that they will be information and policy gatekeepers, managers of security processes, incident response personnel, and security operations staff. 23. If necessary for privileged testing, the client must provide two, separate, access tokens whether they be passwords, certificates, secure ID numbers, badges, etc. and they should be typical to the users of the privileges being tested rather than especially empty or secure accesses. 24. When testing includes known privileges, the Analyst must first test without privileges (such as in a black box environment) prior to testing again with privileges. 25. The Analysts are required to know their tools, where the tools came from, how the tools work, and have them tested in a restricted test area before using the tools on the client organization. 26. The conduct of tests which are explicitly meant to test the denial of a service or process or survivability may only be done with explicit permission and only to the scope where no damage is done outside of the scope or the community in which the scope resides. 27. Tests involving people may only be performed on those identified in the scope and may not include private persons, customers, partners, associates, or other external entities without written permission from those entities. 28. Verified limitations, such as discovered breaches, vulnerabilities with known or high exploitation rates, vulnerabilities which are exploitable for full, unmonitored or untraceable access, or which may immediately endanger lives, discovered during testing must be reported to the customer with a practical solution as soon as they are found. 29. Any form of flood testing where a scope is overwhelmed from a larger and stronger source is forbidden over", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 29}}
