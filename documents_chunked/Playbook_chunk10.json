{"text": "you may be required to use specific forensic software to make a claim. 3. Keep shared data in central locations like a network access storage (NAS) server. That minimizes the amount of loss that occurs when a particular desktop fails. Standardized installs of desktops and daily-use devices along with nightly backups further shorten the time to full recovery. Being prepared for recovery will allow most compromised systems to be completely copied for forensics, wiped, and reinstalled to nearly full operation in under two hours. 4. Back up everything — even your centralized data. It’s the only way to assure a complete recovery. Set up all data services and file servers to be backed up and redundant with fall-back servers. This assures continuity and resilience so that server failure does not mean loss of service. THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 2: THE GAME PLAN 15 5. Have emergency contact numbers for vendor support. If a forensics investigation uncovers why a particular attack was successful it may require immediate attention in the form of a patch, a configuration change, or both. 6. Consider investing in a distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection service. This can be especially important if your business relies on customers having timely access to an online presence such as an online store. There are many of these and it’s possible your hosting provider already offers this. However, you do need to make sure you know how much DDoS protection they can offer and perhaps invest in a vendor who specializes in it. THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 2: THE GAME PLAN 16 Use Your Home Field Advantage The Internet is a hostile environment. That’s the reason we go to so much trouble to make sure our networks are able to interact but still remain separated from it. However more than just creating a safe environments for our users we need to take things one step further and also make them hostile environments for attackers. Creating an atmosphere and conditions that make it easy for you to thrive but difficult for your opponents — in sports this is what people refer to as home field advantage. Sometimes it can simply involve extra motivation and support from fans, but in some contexts there really are environmental factors involved. Some teams are better conditioned to perform on grass vs. synthetic fields. Others do better at high altitudes or in extreme heat or cold. In cybersecurity, there are three primary “home field advantages” you should be striving to leverage: visibility, protocol, and process. Do that and you can exploit the fact that, in order to do damage, attackers have to play the “away team” role. They have to come into your environment and contend with a network of systems you know better than anyone else. Here’s how to make the most of your home field advantages: 1. Know what’s happening on your network. This is probably your greatest home field advantage.
