{"text": "using operational metrics. An operational metric is a constant measurement that informs us of a factual count in relation to the physical world we live in. They are operational because they are numbers we can work with consistently from day to day and person to person. It is difficult to work with relative or inconsistent measurements like choosing a specific hue of yellow to paint a room, starting work at sunrise, having the right flavor of strawberry for a milkshake, or preparing for the next threat to affect your organization’s profits because the factors have many variables which are biased or frequently changing between people, regions, customs, and locations. For this reason, many professions attempt to standardize such things like flavors, colors, and work hours. This is done through reductionism, a process of finding the elements of such things and building them up from there by quantifying those elements. This way, colors become frequencies, work hours become hours and minutes, flavors become chemical compounds, and an attack surface becomes porosity, controls, and limitations. The only real problem with operational metrics is the requirement for knowing how to properly apply the metric for it to be useful. Using ravs to measure and track the security of anything over time. The completion of a thorough security test has the advantage of providing accurate metrics on the state of security. As with the use of any metric. the less thorough the test, the less accurate the overall metric. Less skilled or less experienced Analysts will also adversely affect the quality of the metric just as people who can’t tell time can’t build clocks, designers without the right tools can’t match colors exactly, and Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution-Non-Commercial-NoDerivs 2010, ISECOM, www.isecom.org, www.osstmm.org 62\\nbrew masters who can’t measure the ingredients in beer can’t make similar batches repeatedly for market. Therefore a successful security metric requires a test which can be described as measuring the appropriate vectors while accounting for inaccuracies and misrepresentations in the collected test data as well as the skills or experience of the security professionals performing the test. Faults in these requirements result in lower quality measurements and false security determinations therefore the metric must also be simple enough to use without making it so simple that it tells nothing. Furthermore, a proper security metric must avoid the biases inherent in risk assessments by assuring measurements have integrity. These qualities have been combined to create the ravs, an unbiased, factual description of an attack surface. 4.1 Getting to Know the Rav The rav is a scale measurement of the attack surface, the amount of uncontrolled interactions with a target, which is calculated by the quantitative balance between operations, limitations, and controls. Having the ravs is to understand how much of the attack surface is exposed. In this scale, 100 rav (also shown as 100% rav for simplicity of understanding although not precisely a percentage) is perfect balance and anything less is too few controls and therefore a greater attack surface.
