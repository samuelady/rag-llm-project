{"text": "defined within the scope: Operational Security, Controls and Limitations. In order to begin, we must first aggregate and associate all of our input information into the appropriate categories for each input variable. The rav equation requires that each of the categories be assigned a logarithmic base value to scale the three factors of Actual Security in accordance with the scope. The information contained within the rav is comprised of how operations balances with controls and limitations. There are no \"weights\" to skew the results leaving a flexible quantification of the attack surface that allows it to be compared to the security of anything else no matter size, vector, or Channel.

It is initially measured as the sum of the scope’s visibility ( P ), access (P ),and V A trust (P ). T OpSec  P  P  P sum V A T When calculating the rav it is however necessary to determine the Operational Security base value, OpSec . The Operational Security base value is given by the equation base OpSec  log2 1100OpSec  . base sum Since the logarithm of 0 is not defined in the calculation we needed to include the 1+100 here. The log of 1 is 0. So if we have 0 Porosity and want to express this lack of interaction as perfect security of 100 rav then we needed to add +1 to the equation. Without the 1+100 we would have undefined numbers in the case that the sums of any of those factors are 0. This is required by the methodology because the absence of interactions represents perfect security and therefore the logarithm should equal 0 to provide the 100 rav. 4.5 The Controls Formula The next step in calculating the rav is to define the Loss Controls; the security mechanisms put in place to protect the operations. First the sum of the Loss Controls, LC , must be determined by adding together sum the 10 Loss Control categories. Controls Class A Authentication LC Au Indemnification LC Id Resilience LC Re Subjugation LC Su Continuity LC Ct Class B Non-Repudiation LC NR Confidentiality LC Cf Privacy LC Pr Integrity LC It Alarm LC Al Thus the Loss Control sum LC is given as sum LC  LC  LC  LC LC  LC  LC  LC  LC LC LC . sum Au Id Re Su Ct NR Cf Pr It Al Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution-Non-Commercial-NoDerivs 2010, ISECOM, www.isecom.org, www.osstmm.org 80\\nMissing Controls Given that the combination of each of the 10 Loss Controls balance the value of 1 OpSec loss (visibility, access, trust) it is necessary to determine the amount of Missing Controls, MC , in order to assess the sum value of the Security Limitations. This must be done individually for each of the 10 Loss Control", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 65}}
