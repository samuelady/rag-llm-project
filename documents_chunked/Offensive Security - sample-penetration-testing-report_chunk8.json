{"text": "to mitigate the impact of the discovered vulnerabilities. The specific goals of the penetration test were stated as: o Identifying if a remote attacker could penetrate MegaCorp One’s defenses o Determining the impact of a security breach on: o Confidentiality of the company’s information o Internal infrastructure and availability of MegaCorp One’s information systems These goals of the penetration test were met. A targeted attack against MegaCorp One can result in a complete compromise of organizational assets. Multiple issues that would typically be considered minor were leveraged in concert, resulting in a total compromise of the MegaCorp One’s information systems. It is important to note that this collapse of the entire MegaCorp One security infrastructure can be greatly attributed to insufficient access controls at both the network boundary and host levels. Appropriate efforts should be undertaken to introduce effective network segmentation, which could help mitigate the effect of cascading security failures throughout the MegaCorp One infrastructure.

Page 28 of 34\\nRecommendations Due to the impact to the overall organization as uncovered by this penetration test, appropriate resources should be allocated to ensure that remediation efforts are accomplished in a timely manner. While a comprehensive list of items that should be implemented is beyond the scope of this engagement, some high level items are important to mention. Offensive Security recommends the following: 1. Ensure that strong credentials are use everywhere in the organization. The compromise of MegaCorp One system as drastically impacted by the use of weak passwords as well as the reuse of passwords across systems of differing security levels. NIST SP 800-119 is recommended for guidelines on operating an enterprise password policy. While this issue was not widespread within MegaCorp One, it was still an issue and should be addressed. 2. Establish trust boundaries. Create logical boundaries of trust where appropriate on the internal network. Each logical trust segment should be able to be compromised without the breach easily cascading to other segments. This should include the use of unique administrative accounts so that a compromised system in one segment cannot be used in other locations. 3. Implement and enforce implementation of change control across all systems: Misconfiguration and insecure deployment issues were discovered across the various systems. The vulnerabilities that arose can be mitigated through the use of change control processes on all server systems. 4. Implement a patch management program: Operating a consistent patch management program per the guidelines outlined in NIST SP 800-4010 is an important component in maintaining good security posture. This will help to limit the attack surface that results from running unpatched internal services. 5. Conduct regular vulnerability assessments. As part of an effective organizational risk management strategy, vulnerability assessments should be conducted on a regular basis. Doing so will allow the organization to determine if the installed security controls are properly installed, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome.
