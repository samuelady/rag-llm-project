{"text": "can also invest in the appropriate type of separation or controls required and create precise plans for disasters and contingencies. Although the Limitations are categorized here as 1 through 5 this does not mean they are in a hierarchical format of severity. Rather they are numbered only to differentiate them both for operational planning and metrics. This also means it is possible that more than one type of Limitation can be applied to a single problem. Furthermore, the weight (value) of a particular Limitation is based on the other available and corresponding controls and interactive areas to the scope, there can be no specific hierarchy since the value of each is specific to the protective measures in the scope being audited. Within the OSSTMM the five Limitation classifications are: 1. Vulnerability is the flaw or error that: (a) denies access to assets for authorized people or processes, (b) allows for privileged access to assets to unauthorized people or processes, or (c) allows unauthorized people or processes to hide assets or themselves within the scope. 2. Weakness is the flaw or error that disrupts, reduces, abuses, or nullifies specifically the effects of the five interactivity controls: authentication, indemnification, resilience, subjugation, and continuity. 3. Concern is the flaw or error that disrupts, reduces, abuses, or nullifies the effects of the flow or execution of the five process controls: non-repudiation, confidentiality, privacy, integrity, and alarm. 4. Exposure is an unjustifiable action, flaw, or error that provides direct or indirect visibility of targets or assets within the chosen scope channel. 5. Anomaly is any unidentifiable or unknown element which has not been controlled and cannot be accounted for in normal operations.

A vulnerability is the flaw or error that: (a) denies access to assets for authorized people or processes (b) allows for privileged access to assets to unauthorized people or processes, or (c) allows unauthorized people or processes to hide assets or themselves within the scope. This means that Vulnerability must be mapped to all points of interaction or OpSec and because Vulnerability can circumnavigate or nullify the Controls, these must also be considered in the weighting of Vulnerability. A weakness is a flaw in Class A Controls however can impact OpSec therefore it is mapped to all OpSec parameters as well as being mapped to this interactive class of controls. A concern can only be found in Class B Controls however can impact OpSec therefore it is mapped to all OpSec parameters as well as being mapped to this process class of controls.
