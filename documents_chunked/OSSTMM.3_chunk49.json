Failed Security Processes and Procedures During analysis, test results will show more than just the OpSec, types of controls, and number of limitations. It will show a bigger picture, one of processes and procedures that are in use to formalize protective measures. These can be about anything that are designed to get the protection measures to their current state. This includes but is not limited to maintenance, procurement, identification, authorization, housekeeping, disaster recovery, partner relations, policy generation, climate control, and human resources. When a target has a limitation often times there is a failed process or procedure behind it. The Analyst should be able to determine exactly what it is from the aggregate test results. 6. Good Practices The term “Best Practices” is used to explain the best way for a person or organization to do something. Unfortunately, this has been abused to the point where it now means that it’s best for everyone. This itself has caused problems and wasted resources. One way to counter this problem is to use the aggregate test results to show practices which are successful. This will show what can be repeated for equivalent success in other areas of the organization and defining a customized “Best Practice” for them. It will also lessen their reliance on industry-wide Best Practices in favor of what works best for them. 7. Compliance Should specific compliance objectives need to be reached, the Analyst needs to use the correlated test results to determine if these objectives have been met. This may need to be provided in a special format as determined by the auditor however the Analyst is best equipped to show which test results provide the necessary information.

It works for defining strategy. Security testing however is verifying to what completeness that security or those controls exist. It works for defining operations. To test you don’t make a risk assessment because doing so would restrict your potential and your findings. After all, you shouldn’t be making the same guesses they are.

When we measure the height, width, or length of an object we are using an operational metric. When we write the date, have a birthday, or ask the score of a game we are using operational metrics. An operational metric is a constant measurement that informs us of a factual count in relation to the physical world we live in. They are operational because they are numbers we can work with consistently from day to day and person to person. It is difficult to", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 49}}
