They may be a resource internal or external to the entity.  Social engineering: Manipulation or deception of individuals into divulging confidential or personal information.  White-box testing: Testing performed with knowledge of the internal structure/design/implementation of the object being tested. 1.4 Navigating this Document This document is organized in such a way to help the reader better understand penetration testing in a holistic sense. It begins by providing background and definitions for topics common to all penetration test efforts (including scoping the test, critical systems to test, application and network-layer test inclusions, etc.). The document then moves on to practical guidance on selecting a penetration tester, methodologies that are used before, during, and after a test, guidelines for reporting and evaluating test results. The document concludes with case studies that attempt to illustrate the concepts presented in this supplement. Appendix A provides a quick-reference table to specific sections of this document where guidance on a particular PCI DSS requirement can be found. This may be useful for those wishing to quickly correlate the penetration testing requirements and guidelines presented in PCI DSS Requirement 11.3. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 5\\n2 Penetration Testing Components The goals of penetration testing are: 1. To determine whether and how a malicious user can gain unauthorized access to assets that affect the fundamental security of the system, files, logs and/or cardholder data. 2. To confirm that the applicable controls required by PCI DSS—such as scope, vulnerability management, methodology, and segmentation—are in place. There are three types of penetration tests: black-box, white-box, and grey-box. In a black-box assessment, the client provides no information prior to the start of testing. In a white-box assessment, the entity may provide the penetration tester with full and complete details of the network and applications. For grey-box assessments, the entity may provide partial details of the target systems. PCI DSS penetration tests are typically performed as either white-box or grey-box assessments. These types of assessments yield more accurate results and provide a more comprehensive test of the security posture of the environment than a pure black-box assessment. Performing a black-box assessment, when the entity provides no details of the target systems prior to the start of the test, may require more time, money, and resources for the deliverables to meet the requirements of PCI DSS. 2.1 How does a penetration test differ from a vulnerability scan? The differences between penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, as required by PCI DSS, can be summarized as follows: Vulnerability Scan Penetration Test Purpose Identify, rank, and report vulnerabilities that, if Identify ways to exploit vulnerabilities to exploited, may result in an intentional or circumvent or defeat the security features of unintentional compromise of a system. system components.
