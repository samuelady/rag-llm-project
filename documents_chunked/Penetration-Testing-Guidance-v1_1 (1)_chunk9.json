{"text": "Advanced Penetration Tester (GXPN))  CREST Penetration Testing Certifications  Communication Electronic Security Group (CESG) IT Health Check Service (CHECK) certification Note: The PCI SSC does not validate or endorse these certifications. 3.2 Past Experience Appropriate penetration testing experience and qualifications cannot be met by certifications alone. Therefore, confirmation of additional criteria is necessary. For example, review of the extent of actual engagements that have been performed and relevant work experience are important considerations when selecting a penetration tester or team. The following questions are examples for assessing the qualifications and competency of a penetration tester or team. This is not an exhaustive list: Q How many years’ experience does the penetration tester have? • If the penetration tester is in their first year of penetration testing, careful consideration should be given to the following questions to ensure the penetration tester has sufficient knowledge and is adequately trained to perform the penetration test. Consideration should also be given to the organization itself by verifying the training and QA processes to ensure penetration tester is qualified. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 12\\nQ How many years has the organization that employs the penetration tester been performing penetration tests? • References from other customers may be useful in consideration. Q Has the penetration tester performed assessments against organizations of similar size and scope? • For environments with high availability constraints, unstable system components, or large infrastructures, it is important to evaluate a tester’s ability to handle those restrictions (bandwidth constraints, time constraints, etc.). Q What penetration testing experience has the penetration tester or team had with the technologies in the target environment (i.e., operating systems, hardware, web applications, highly customized applications, network services, protocols, etc.)? • When selecting a penetration tester, it is important to evaluate the past testing experience of the organization for which the tester works as it pertains to technologies specifically deployed within the target environment. • Even if the penetration tester has not performed an assessment against certain specific technologies, if the tester has managed, maintained, been trained on, or developed said technologies, the tester may still be qualified to perform the penetration test. Q Consider what other skills/qualifications the penetration tester has that will contribute to their ability to assess the environment. • Are there industry-standard penetration testing certifications held by the penetration tester? (See Section 3.1.) • What type of experience does the penetration tester have conducting network-layer penetration testing? Discussion of examples of network penetration testing efforts conducted by the organization may be warranted. • Does the penetration tester have experience conducting application-layer penetration testing? Discussion of the penetration tester’s familiarity with testing to validate the OWASP Top 10 and other similar application secure-coding standards and examples of application penetration testing efforts conducted by the organization may be warranted. Note: An organization may want to consider having a development-environment lab where penetration tests can be performed outside of the production environment and internal resources can train", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Penetration-Testing-Guidance-v1_1 (1)", "chunk_id": 9}}
