In COMSEC telecommunications, a concern can be the use of a FAX machine for sending private information or a voice mail system that uses touch tones for entering a PIN or password. In SPECSEC, a concern can be a wireless access point using weak data encryption or an infrared door opener that cannot read the sender in the rain.

In PHYSSEC, an exposure can be a window which allows one to view assets and processes or a power meter that shows how much energy a building uses and its fluctuation over time. In HUMSEC, an exposure can be a guard who allows all visitors to view the list of names on the sign-in sheet or a company operator who informs callers that a particular person is out sick or on vacation. In COMSEC data security, an exposure can be a descriptive and valid 4 Exposure banner about a service (disinformation banners are not exposures) or an ICMP echo reply from a host. In COMSEC telecommunications, an exposure can be an automated company directory sorted alphabetically, allowing anyone to cycle through all persons and numbers, or a FAX machine that stores the last dialed numbers. In SPECSEC, an exposure can be a signal that disrupts other machinery or an infrared device whose operation is visible by standard video cameras with night capability. Count each unidentifiable or unknown element which cannot be accounted for in normal operations, generally when the source or destination of the element cannot be understood. An anomaly may be an early sign of a security problem. Since unknowns are elements which cannot be controlled, a proper audit requires noting any and all anomalies. In PHYSSEC, an anomaly can be dead birds discovered on the roof a building around communications equipment. In HUMSEC, an anomaly can be questions a guard asks which may seem 5 Anomaly irrelevant to either the job or standard small talk. In COMSEC data security, an anomaly can be correct responses to a probe from a different IP address than was probed or expected. In COMSEC telecommunications, an anomaly can be a modem response from a number that has no modem. In SPECSEC, an anomaly can be a local signal that cannot be properly located nor does it do any known harm.

In order to begin, we must first aggregate and associate all of our input information into the appropriate categories for each input variable. The rav equation requires that each of the categories be assigned a logarithmic base value to scale the", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 64}}
