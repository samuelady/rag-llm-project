The primary tenet for auditing states, in similar regard to a conformational bias: “When one searches for something, one expects to find it, which may lead you to finding only what you are searching for.” In the OSSTMM, each module begins as an input and ends as an output exactly for the reason of keeping bias minimal. Therefore, each task gives a direction of what should be revealed to move to another point within the methodology.

A trust analysis can also be used to predetermine which modules need to be performed as independent tests. However, remember that modules are parts of a whole test and the assumption that any particular module can just be omitted is false and will lead to an improper test. If there is no input for a particular module though, it may be omitted without degrading the quality of the test. The difference is that, in the first case, the module or task is ignored based on a trust decision while in the second the test itself dictated that the module or task cannot be performed. With the provision of testing as a service, it is important to communicate to the target owner exactly what of the scope has not or will not be tested. This manages expectations and potentially inappropriate risk assurances in the security of a system. Testing time with the modules is relative to the plan. For example, if the Analyst tests the physical security of a door, then the test would have at least two vectors: the door’s functional security from the outside of the room to the inside, and then from the inside of the room to the outside. Determining the proper scope based on the vector is important because there may still be targets outside of the vector and still within the scope which will not make up the current testing scope. Overall, larger scopes with multiple channels and multiple vectors require more time spent on each module and its tasks. The amount of time allowed before returning with output data is not determined by this methodology and depends on the Analyst, the target, the test environment, and the test plan. 6.1 Methodology Flow The OSSTMM does not allow for a separation between what is considered active data collection and verification through agitation; because, in both cases, interaction is required. Nor does it differentiate between active and passive testing where active testing is the agitation to create an interaction with the target and passive testing is the recording, aggregation, and analysis of emanations from the target. This methodology requires both active and passive tests. Furthermore, the Analyst may not be able to differentiate between data collected passively from emanations of the operations and that", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 78}}
