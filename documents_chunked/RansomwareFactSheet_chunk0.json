{"text": "U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Office for Civil Rights FACT SHEET: Ransomware and HIPAA A recent U.S. Government interagency report indicates that, on average, there have been 4,000 daily ransomware attacks since early 2016 (a 300% increase over the 1,000 daily ransomware attacks reported in 2015).1 Ransomware exploits human and technical weaknesses to gain access to an organization’s technical infrastructure in order to deny the organization access to its own data by encrypting that data. However, there are measures known to be effective to prevent the introduction of ransomware and to recover from a ransomware attack. This document describes ransomware attack prevention and recovery from a healthcare sector perspective, including the role the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) has in assisting HIPAA covered entities and business associates to prevent and recover from ransomware attacks, and how HIPAA breach notification processes should be managed in response to a ransomware attack. 1. What is ransomware? Ransomware is a type of malware (malicious software) distinct from other malware; its defining characteristic is that it attempts to deny access to a user’s data, usually by encrypting the data with a key known only to the hacker who deployed the malware, until a ransom is paid. After the user’s data is encrypted, the ransomware directs the user to pay the ransom to the hacker (usually in a cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin) in order to receive a decryption key. However, hackers may deploy ransomware that also destroys or exfiltrates2 data, or ransomware in conjunction with other malware that does so. 2. Can HIPAA compliance help covered entities and business associates prevent infections of malware, including ransomware? Yes. The HIPAA Security Rule requires implementation of security measures that can help prevent the introduction of malware, including ransomware. Some of these required security measures include: • implementing a security management process, which includes conducting a risk analysis to identify threats and vulnerabilities to electronic protected health information (ePHI) and implementing security measures to mitigate or remediate those identified risks; • implementing procedures to guard against and detect malicious software; 1 United States Government Interagency Guidance Document, How to Protect Your Networks from Ransomware available at https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips/file/872771/download. 2 Exfiltration is “[t]he unauthorized transfer of information from an information system.” NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations.

The Security Management Process standard of the Security Rule includes requirements for all covered entities and business associates to conduct an accurate and thorough risk analysis of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all of the ePHI the entities create, receive, maintain, or transmit and to implement security measures sufficient to reduce those identified risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable", "metadata": {"doc_id": "RansomwareFactSheet", "chunk_id": 0}}
