Writing the first draft Start writing a rough draft report using all relevant information gathered in stage 2.2 using the relevant notes. At this stage, it is highly recommended not to be concerned about proofreading and editing. Typically, 60% of report writing time will be in writing the draft. It may be helpful to use a symbol such as \"#\" or adding highlights to mark the spot where pen-tester needs to check back later to edit a paragraph. Delete the symbol once editing is completed. )*+,%\"&(!.$*&/01(2$*&/0342*0.-5%2( ( ( @ 2021 SANS Institute Author Retains Full Rights\\n! ! (A&0#0+4(*(M:+:#&*#0%+(C:,#0+4(N:<%&# S( ! ( ! 2.4.

Page design In report planning, page design needs to be decided upon to develop the look and feel of the report. This includes but not limited to the header and footer content, fonts to be used and colors. This will be controlled based on how the service provider's document looks and feels. 3.2. Document Control Document control will be based on the service provider control of document procedure. Here are some recommended sections and contents. Cover Page This will show the report name, report version, date, the author/service provider name, cover page may also include document serial number and target organization name. )*+,%\"&(!.$*&/01(2$*&/0342*0.-5%2( ( ( @ 2021 SANS Institute Author Retains Full Rights\\n! !", "metadata": {"doc_id": "SANS Institute - Writing a Penetration Testing", "chunk_id": 4}}
