(b) Determine the property location and the owner of the property housing the targets. (c) Verify the owner of the targets from network registration information. (d) Verify the owner of the target domains from domain registration information. (e) Verify the ISP(s) providing network access or redundancy. (f) Search for other IP blocks and targets related to the same owner(s). (g) Search for similar domain names or mistyped domain names which can be confused with the target. (h) Verify which target domain names resolve to systems outside of the owner’s control such as caching devices. (i) Verify which target IP addresses trace back to locations different from the owner’s location. (j) Verify that reverse name look-ups of target system addresses correspond with the scope and the scope owner. (k) Find and verify the paths of network services which interact outside of target for the paths they follow into and out of the scope. (l) Prepare local name resolution to map domain names only to the specific systems to be tested and not any devices outside the target or target ownership. (m)Use reverse name look-ups as an additional information source towards determining the existence of all the machines in a network. 11.2.2 Network Quality (a) Measure the rate of speed and packet loss to the scope for a requested service in TCP, UDP, and ICMP both as a whole service request and as a request/response pair. Repeat each request in succession at least 100 times and record the average for both whole service requests and packet responses for each of the three protocols. (b) Determine sending and receiving packet rates for a total of 6 averages (per protocol) as requests per second per network segment in the scope. (c) Record packet loss percentages for the determined packet sending and receiving rates. 11.2.3 Time (a) Verify timezone, holidays, and work schedules for the various systems within the scope including partners, resellers, and influential customers interacting with the scope. (b) Identify the Time To Live (TTL) distance to the gateway and the targets. (c) Assure the Analyst’s clock is in sync with the time of the targets.

It may be necessary to coordinate these tests with the appropriate persons within the scope. 11.3.1 Filtering (a) Test whether INCOMING network data or communications over web, instant messaging, chat, web-based forums, or e-mail, are monitored or filtered by", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 117}}
