{"text": "issues can be corrected without the need for third-party tools. Microsoft’s Active Directory contains settings that can be used to minimize the risk of these resources being abused for the benefit of malicious users. A webserver was also found to be running a web application that used weak and easily guessable credentials to access an administrative console that can be leveraged to gain unauthorized access to the underlying server. This could be exploited by an attacker on the internal network without needing a valid user account. This attack is very well- documented, so it is an exceedingly likely target can be particularly damaging, even in the hands of an unskilled attacker. Ideally, direct external access to this service would be disabled, but if it cannot be, it should be reconfigured with exceptionally strong credentials that are rotated frequently. Inlanefreight may also want to consider maximizing the log data collected from this device to ensure that attacks against it can be detected and triaged quickly. 6\\nThe tester also found shared folders with excessive permissions, meaning that all users in the internal network can access a considerable amount of data. While sharing files internally between departments and users is important to day-to-day business operations, wide open permissions on file shares may result in unintentional disclosure of confidential information. Even if a file share does not contain any sensitive information today, someone may unwittingly put such data there thinking it is protected when it isn’t. This configuration should be changed to ensure that users can access only what is necessary to perform their day-to-day duties. Finally, the tester noticed that testing activities seemed to go mostly unnoticed, which may represent an opportunity to improve visibility into the internal network and indicates that a real-world attacker might remain undetected if internal access is achieved. Inlanefreight should create a remediation plan based on the Remediation Summary section of this report, addressing all high findings as soon as possible according to the needs of the business. Inlanefreight should also consider performing periodic vulnerability assessments if they are not already being performed. Once the issues identified in this report have been addressed, a more collaborative, in-depth Active Directory security assessment may help identify additional opportunities to harden the Active Directory environment, making it more difficult for attackers to move around the network and increasing the likelihood that Inlanefreight will be able to detect and respond to suspicious activity. 7\\nNetwork Penetration Test Assessment Summary Hack The Box Academy began all testing activities from the perspective of an unauthenticated user on the internal network. Inlanefreight provided the tester with network ranges but did not provide additional information such as operating system or configuration information. Summary of Findings During the course of testing, Hack The Box Academy uncovered a total of seven (7) findings that pose a material risk to Inlanefreight’s information systems. Hack The Box Academy also identified one informational finding that, if addressed, could further strengthen Inlanefreight’s overall security posture. Informational findings are observations for areas of improvement", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Hack the Box - sample-penetration-testing-report-template", "chunk_id": 2}}
