Network administrators often use remote administration protocols to control devices like switches, routers, and other essential systems. However, allowing these services to be accessible via the Internet can increase security risks, creating potential opportunities for attacks on the organization. Risk description Exposing this service online with username/password authentication can enable attackers to launch authentication attacks, like guessing login credentials, and potentially gaining unauthorized access. Vulnerabilities, such as unpatched software, protocol flaws, or backdoors could also be exploited. An example is the CVE-2024-3094 (XZ Utils Backdoor) vulnerability. Recommendation We recommend turning off SSH with username/password authentication access over the Internet and instead using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) that mandates two-factor authentication (2FA). If the SSH service is essential for business purposes, we recommend limiting access only from designated IP addresses using a firewall. Furthermore, it is advisable to utilize SSH Public Key Authentication since it employs a key pair to verify the identity of a user or process.

PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION 6379/tcp open redis Redis key-value store 5.0.7 How to reproduce nmap -p 6379 -sV -n --open pentest-ground.com Vulnerability description We found that the Redis service is publicly accessible. This service often holds critical organizational data, making it a potential prime target for determined attackers. Risk description The risk exists that an attacker exploits this issue by launching a password-based attack on the Redis service. If an attacker identifies a correct set of login details, they could gain access to the database and start enumerating, potentially revealing confidential information. Moreover, such vulnerabilities could lead to other forms of attacks, including privilege escalation, allowing attackers to run system commands and move laterally to other systems in the internal network. 101\\nRecommendation We recommend ensuring that the Redis service is not publicly accessible.
