The Analyst makes the cause and analyzes the effect on the target. It is strange that this is the primary means of testing something as critical as security because although it makes for a very fast test, it is also highly prone to errors, some of which may be devastating to the target. Consider that in a security test using the echo process, a target that does not respond is considered secure.

If hospitals used the echo process to determine the health of an individual, it would rarely help people, but at least the waiting room time would be very short. Hospitals however, like most other scientific industries, apply the Four Point Process which includes a function of the echo process called the “interaction” as one of the four tests. The other three tests are: the “inquest” of reading emanations from the patient such as pulse, blood pressure, and brain waves; the “intervention” of changing and stressing operating conditions such as the patient’s homeostasis, behavior, routine, or comfort level; and the “induction” of examining the environment and how it may have affected the target such analyzing what the patient has interacted with, touched, eaten, drank, or breathed in. However, in security testing, the majority of tests are based on the echo process alone. There is so much information lost in such one- dimensional testing we should be thankful that the health care industry has evolved past just the “Does it hurt if I do this?” manner of diagnosis. The security test process in this methodology does not recommend the echo process alone for reliable results. While the echo process may be used for certain, particular tests where the error margin is small and the increased efficiency allows for time to be moved to other time-intensive techniques, it is not recommended for tests outside of a deterministic environment. The Analyst must choose carefully when and under what conditions to apply the echo process. While many testing processes exist, the Four Point Process for security testing is designed for optimum efficiency, accuracy, and thoroughness to assure test validity and minimize errors in uncontrolled and stochastic environments. It is optimized for real-world test scenarios outside of the lab. While it also uses agitation, it differs from the echo process in that it allows for determining more than one cause per effect and more than one effect per cause.
