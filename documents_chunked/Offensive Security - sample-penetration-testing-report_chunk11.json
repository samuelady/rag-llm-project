{"text": "includes selective verification of discovered issues through exploitation. This allows service providers the ability to conduct the work largely through the use of automated toolsets and maintain consistency of product across multiple engagements. Penetration testing for impact is a form of attack simulation under controlled conditions, which closely mimics the real world, targeted attacks that organizations face on a day-to-day basis. Penetration testing for impact is a goal-based assessment, which creates more than a simple vulnerability inventory, instead providing the true business impact of a breach. An impact-based penetration test identifies areas for improvement that will result in the highest rate of return for the business. Penetration testing for impact poses the challenge of requiring a high skillset to successfully complete. As demonstrated in this sample report, Offensive Security believes that it is uniquely qualified to deliver world-class results when conducting penetration tests for impact, due to the level of expertise found within our team of security professionals. Offensive Security does not maintain a separate team for penetration testing and other activities that the company is engaged in. This means that the same individuals that are involved in Offensive Security’s industry leading performance-based training, the production of industry standard tools such as Kali Linux, authors of best selling books, creators of 0-day exploits, and maintainers of industry references such as Exploit-DB are the same individuals that are involved in the delivery of services. Offensive Security offers a product that cannot be matched in the market. However, we may not be the right fit for every job. Offensive Security typically conducts consulting services with a low volume, high skill ratio to allow Offensive Security staff to more closely mimic real world situations. This also allows customers to have increased access to industry-recognized expertise all while keeping costs reasonable. As such, high volume/fast turn-around engagements are often not a good fit for our services. Offensive Security is focused on conducting high quality, high impact assessments and is actively sought out by customers in need of services that cannot be delivered by other vendors.
