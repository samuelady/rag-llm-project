A typical penetration test involves obtaining and evaluating evidence using a formal methodology; evidence collected from the penetration test is used to determine the conclusion. Evidence is considered all information that supports the penetration tester’s conclusions about the effectiveness of the security controls and the environment’s overall security posture. The penetration tester should follow a systematic process to securely collect, handle, and store evidence. Examples of evidence include but are not limited to screenshots, raw tool output (i.e., NMAP, burp suite, Nessus, TCPDump Wireshark, etc.), acquired dumps in case of exploitation (i.e., database files, logs, configuration files etc.), photos, recordings, and anything that may support the final conclusion of the penetration test report. It should be noted that if cardholder data is acquired during the penetration test, it is recommended that it be kept to a minimum. For example, a database full of cardholder data should not be dumped to the tester’s machine or system. 5.3.2 Retention It is recommended that procedures for retention and destruction of evidence be documented for all parties involved prior to commencing the penetration test. If a third party is used to perform the penetration test, contract language should be reviewed to confirm these procedures are clear. While there are currently no PCI DSS requirements regarding the retention of evidence collected by the penetration tester, it is a recommended best practice that such evidence be retained by the tester (whether internal to the organization or a third-party provider) for a period of time while considering any local, regional, or company laws that must be followed for the retention of evidence. This evidence should be available upon request from the target entity or other authorized entities as defined in the rules of engagement. If, however, a tester stores cardholder data obtained during the engagement, the data must be stored by the tester following the guidelines of the PCI DSS for the storage of account data—i.e., encrypted using strong cryptography, truncated/hashed, or not stored. Storage of account data by the tester is not recommended. This data should be securely wiped from tester systems at the conclusion of the engagement.
