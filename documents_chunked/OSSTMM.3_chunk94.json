(b) Verify the process of authenticating which items may be taken into the scope by both authorized and unauthorized personnel. (c) Verify the process of authenticating which items may be taken out of the scope by both authorized and unauthorized personnel. (d) Verify the process of recording access and which items were entered and removed. 8.5.3 Location (a) Map the distance from the scope perimeter to the visible targets and assets from outside the scope. (b) Map and identify all paths to access points which can be reached in a noisy, not stealthy, direct (3 seconds or less time on target) interaction with that access point. This may include attacks which are sans conatus (without regard for the attacker’s life). 8.5.4 Penetration (a) Determine which barriers and obstacles in the scope provide remote access to change, disrupt, destroy, or obtain assets (visually, aurally, and magnetically). (b) Determine the effectiveness of barriers and obstacles to withstand conditions defined in the Posture Review. (c) Determine and rate the effectiveness of barriers and obstacles to withstand fire, explosions, and general concussive forces such as gunshots and vehicular ramming. (d) Determine and rate the effectiveness of barriers and obstacles to reduce incoming: critical noise levels, heat, cold, smoke, humidity, disruptive or caustic odors, intense magnetic fields, harmful light, and pollutants. (e) Determine and rate the effectiveness of barriers and obstacles to reduce outgoing: sounds, smells, vibrations, conditions for acclimatization, smoke, magnetic fields, waste, and pollutants.
