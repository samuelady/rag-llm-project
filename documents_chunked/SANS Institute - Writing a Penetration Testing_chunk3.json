Distributing the softcopy of the report normally will be controlled by the document owner (report owner) and it will be under his responsibility. Finally after submitting the report, the penetration tester should delete any available information that he have and inform the client that all related information has have been erased (This step should be clearly mentioned and agreed upon in the service agreement documents. As Andrew Whitaker and Daniel P. Newman (Whitaker & Newman, 2005) stated that 'your ethical responsibilities do not stop when the test is done, however. After the test is completed, you should perform due diligence to ensure the confidentiality of the test results. Some penetration testing firms have known to circulate test results to other companies as samples of their work. These results contain detailed steps on how to break into an e-finance website for a particular financial institution and collect sensitive customer data. You can imagine the shock of the institution when it discovered these contents being distributed to its competitors!
