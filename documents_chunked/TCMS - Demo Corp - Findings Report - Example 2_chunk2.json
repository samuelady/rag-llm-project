{"text": "surface. It is advised to form a plan of action and patch during the next maintenance window. No vulnerability exists. Additional information is provided regarding Informational N/A items noticed during testing, strong controls, and additional documentation. Risk Factors Risk is measured by two factors: Likelihood and Impact: Likelihood Likelihood measures the potential of a vulnerability being exploited. Ratings are given based on the difficulty of the attack, the available tools, attacker skill level, and client environment. Impact Impact measures the potential vulnerability’s effect on operations, including confidentiality, integrity, and availability of client systems and/or data, reputational harm, and financial loss. Demo Corp BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL Page 6 of 38\\nScope Assessment Details Internal Penetration Test 10.x.x.x/8 Scope Exclusions Per client request, TCMS did not perform any of the following attacks during testing: • Denial of Service (DoS) • Phishing/Social Engineering All other attacks not specified above were permitted by Demo Corp. Client Allowances Demo Corp provided TCMS the following allowances: • Internal access to network via dropbox and port allowances Demo Corp BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL Page 7 of 38\\nExecutive Summary TCMS evaluated Demo Corp’s internal security posture through penetration testing from February 22nd, 2021 to March 5th, 2021. The following sections provide a high-level overview of vulnerabilities discovered, successful and unsuccessful attempts, and strengths and weaknesses. Scoping and Time Limitations Scoping during the engagement did not permit denial of service or social engineering across all testing components. Time limitations were in place for testing. Internal network penetration testing was permitted for ten (10) business days. Testing Summary The network assessment evaluated Demo Corp’s internal network security posture. From an internal perspective, the TCMS team performed vulnerability scanning against all IPs provided by Demo Corp to evaluate the overall patching health of the network. The team also performed common Active Directory based attacks, such as Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) Poisoning, SMB relaying, IPv6 man-in-the-middle relaying, and Kerberoasting. Beyond vulnerability scanning and Active Directory attacks, the TCMS evaluated other potential risks, such as open file shares, default credentials on servers/devices, and sensitive information disclosure to gain a complete picture of the network’s security posture. The TCMS team discovered that LLMNR was enabled in the network (Finding IPT-001), which permitted the interception of user hashes via LLMNR poisoning. These hashes were taken offline and cracked via dictionary attacks, which signals a weak password policy (Finding IPT-005). Utilizing the cracked passwords, the TCMS team gained access to several machines within the network, which indicates overly permissive user accounts. With machine access, and the use of older operating systems in the network (Finding IPT-009), the team was able to leverage WDigest (Finding IPT-003) to recover cleartext credentials to accounts. The team was also able to dump local account hashes on each machine accessed. The TCMS team discovered that the local account hashes were being re-used across devices (Finding IPT-002), which lead to additional machine access through pass-the-hash attacks. Ultimately, the TCMS team was able to leverage accounts captured through WDigest and hash dumps to move laterally throughout", "metadata": {"doc_id": "TCMS - Demo Corp - Findings Report - Example 2", "chunk_id": 2}}
