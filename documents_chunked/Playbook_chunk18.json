{"text": "that security vendors make and sell. Most of all, it skews the knowledge you need to know in order to improve your own security. What you’ll eventually learn is that good security professionals tell you what you want to know. But great security professionals tell you what you need to know. You’ll know when it’s the latter because it will frustrate you and seem like a pain in the ass and leave you wondering if you can’t just buy and install some product. You can. But without putting the work behind any product you install to make it fit your environment and your processes then you won’t fix the problem. More likely, you will create a set of new ones. The cybersecurity field hasn’t matured enough to know what’s right all the time. It has a problem of letting go of what isn’t working. It still tries to base success on effort rather than security. So the first thing you need to do to improve yourself is to stop repeating things like “Everyone gets hacked eventually” and “If a hacker really wants in they’ll get in” and “Security is a process.” Because if our humbling experiences have told us anything, it’s that security isn’t a slogan or a comforting phrase. It’s the toughest riddle you’ll ever have to solve before the Troll comes out from under the bridge and eats you. And every riddle has a different answer every time. It’s constantly changing based on the environment you’re in. THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 3: LOOKING DOWNFIELD 26 So as you set out to win in the cybersecurity field remember that the security community is a resource and not an answer, just like Wikipedia is a resource and not a term paper. What you get from it will rarely fit your needs as-is. You still need to figure out how to answer your own riddle, and that takes knowing your environment, your employees, and how it all works together (aka the Big Picture). You need to know where the interactions are, what resources are being used and from where, as well as who has authorized access to what. And you need to do that constantly because every second, the riddle changes a little bit. Or else before you know it, it’s changed a lot and you’re not ready for what happens next.
