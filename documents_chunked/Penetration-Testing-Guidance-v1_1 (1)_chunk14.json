The organization is strongly encouraged to supply credentials to allow the tester to assume the required roles. This will allow the tester to determine if, at any given role, the user could escalate privileges or otherwise gain access to data they are not explicitly allowed to access. In instances where the organization has created new accounts for the tester to use, it is important that the organization ensure all roles and applicable security in the application have been set up to allow the tester to effectively test all functionality. In instances where a web application utilizes a back-end API, the API may be in scope for the testing. The tester should understand the interaction between the web application and the backend, the functionality exposed by the API, as well as any security controls implemented to protect access to the API. Those, and other factors, will help determine whether the back-end API should be tested independently from the web application. 4.2.2 Network Layer Since most protocols are well defined and have standard modes of interaction, network-layer testing is more suitable for automated testing. This makes automation the first logical step in a network-layer test. Because of such standardization, tools may be used to quickly identify a service, the version of the software, test for common misconfigurations, and even identify vulnerabilities. Automated tests can be performed much faster than could be expected of a human. However, simply running an automated tool does not satisfy the penetration testing requirement. Automated tools cannot interpret vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or even the services exposed to assess the true risk to the environment. The automated tool only serves as a baseline indication of the potential attack surface of the environment. The penetration tester must interpret the results of any automated tools and determine whether additional testing is needed. Using the documentation provided by the organization during the pre-engagement, the tester should:  Verify that only authorized services are exposed at the CDE perimeter.  Attempt to bypass authentication controls from all network segments where authorized users access the CDE, as well as segments not authorized to access the CDE. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 18\\n4.2.3 Segmentation The segmentation check is performed by conducting tests used in the initial stages of a network penetration test (i.e., host discovery, port scanning, etc.). It should verify that all out-of-scope LANs truly have no access to the CDE. For environments with a large number of network segments considered to be out of scope or isolated from the CDE, a representative subset can be used for testing to reduce the number of segmentation checks that need to be performed. Each unique segmentation methodology should be tested to ensure that all security controls are functioning as intended.
