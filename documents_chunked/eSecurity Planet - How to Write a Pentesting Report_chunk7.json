{"text": "and External Penetration Test Reports? The biggest differences between internal and external penetration testing reports will typically be the formality. Internal penetration testing will often be conducted by employees of an organization and external pen testing will be conducted by third parties contracted for the work. Third parties need to demonstrate more value and will often have more polished reports to demonstrate value. However, internal reports still need to accomplish all of the same goals and contain useful information for all readers so the key sections (executive summary, key findings, engagement summary, full pen test results) need to be present and the report must also be usable. What is the Difference Between Application, Website, Infrastructure, and Physical Penetration Test Reports?

The evidence and technical details for findings will be completely different, but the method, common sections, elements, and factors for success for different types of penetration test reports will be the same. Bottom Line: Reports Are the Final Pentesting Product Penetration testing plays an increasingly important role in assessing the health of security systems protecting organizations of all sizes.
