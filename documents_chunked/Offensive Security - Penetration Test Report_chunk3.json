Often times, fragments of tools or user accounts are left on an organization’s computer, which can cause security issues down the road. Ensuring that we are meticulous and no remnants of our penetration test are left over is paramount importance. After the objectives on both the lab network and exam network were successfully completed, OS-XXXXX removed all user accounts and passwords as well as the Meterpreter services installed on the system. Offensive Security should not have to remove any user accounts or services from any of the systems. 4.0 PWK Courses Exercises Course exercises are to be documented, and added in this section of the report. 14 | P a g e", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Offensive Security - Penetration Test Report", "chunk_id": 3}}
