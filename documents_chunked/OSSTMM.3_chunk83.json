This is one methodology which is applicable to any and all types of security tests. Whether the target be a particular system, a location, a person, a process, or thousands of them, this one methodology will assure the most thorough and efficient test possible.

This channel covers the involvement of people, primarily the operating personnel within the target scope or framework. While some services consider this simply as “social engineering”, the true compliance objective of security testing in this channel is personnel security awareness testing and gap measurement to the required security standard outlined in company policy, industry regulations, or regional legislation. The Analyst will be required to have multiple tools and methods for the completion of some tasks to assure that suspicion is not raised among personnel and tests are not made invalid due to an early discovery or heightened paranoia. It may also be pertinent to limit test subjects to one per department or other boundary. Competent Analysts will require both diligent people skills and critical thinking skills to assure factual data collection creates factual results through correlation and analysis. Considerations Please note the following considerations to assure a safe, high quality test: 1. In personam: Scope restrictions target those personnel who are under direct legal contract with the scope owner and, therefore, have legal responsibility for their security awareness and obligations. 2.
