The target response indicates a particular state as either true or false although in reality the state cannot be known. A specter often occurs when the Analyst receives a response from an external stimulus that is perceived to be from the target. A specter may be intentional, an 5 Specter anomaly from within the channel, or the result of carelessness or inexperience from the Analyst. One of the most common problems in the echo process is the assumption that the response is a result of the test. Cause and effect testing in the real world cannot achieve consistently reliable results since neither the cause nor the effect can be properly isolated. Something answers either true or false depending when itâ€™s asked. The target response indicates a particular state as either true or false but only during a particular time, which may or may not follow a pattern. If the response cannot be verified at a time when the state changes, it may prevent the Analyst from comprehending the other state. An Analyst may 6 Indiscretion also determine that this is an anomaly or a problem with testing equipment, especially if the Analyst failed to calibrate the equipment prior to the test or perform appropriate logistics and controls. An indiscretion can be dangerous as it may lead to a false reporting of the state of security. The answer is lost or confused in signal noise. The target response cannot accurately indicate a particular state as either true or false due to a high noise to signal ratio. Akin to the idea of losing a flashlight beam in the sunlight, the Analyst cannot properly determine state 7 Entropy Error until the noise is reduced. This type of environmentally caused error rarely exists in a lab, however it is a normal occurrence in an uncontrolled environment. Entropy can be dangerous, if its effects cannot be countered. The answer changes depending on how and where the question is asked. The target response indicates a particular state as either true or false although in reality the state is dependent upon largely unknown variables 8 Falsification due to target bias. This type of security through obscurity may be dangerous, as the bias will shift when tests come from different vectors or employ different techniques.
