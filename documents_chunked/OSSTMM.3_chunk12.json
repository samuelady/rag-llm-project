{"text": "Therefore it is possible to have total (100%) security if the threat and the asset are completely separated from each other. Otherwise what you have is safety of the asset which is provided by the controls you put on the asset or the degree to which you lessen the impact of the threat. For example, to be secure from lightning, one must move to where lightning can’t reach such as deep in a mountain. Threats which can’t be separated from the assets must be made safer so that their interactions and any effects from interactions do little or no harm. In this same example, to be safe from lightning, one must stay indoors during storms, avoid windows or other openings, and use lightning rods on the roof. Therefore, under the context of operational security, we call security the separation of an asset and a threat and safety the control of a threat or its effects. To have true safety of the assets different types of controls are required. However, controls also may increase the number of interactions within the scope which means more controls are not necessarily better. Therefore it is recommended to use different types of operational controls rather than just more controls. More controls of the same type of operational controls do not provide a defense in depth as access through one is often access through all of that type. This is why it is so important to be able to categorize controls by what they do in operations to be certain of the level of protection provided by them. To better understand how OpSec can work within an operational environment, it must be reduced to its elements. These elements allow one to quantify the Attack Surface, which is the lack of specific separations and functional controls that exist for that Vector, the direction of the interaction. The reductionist approach resolves to us needing to see security and safety in a new way, one that allows for them to exist independent of risk and fully capable of creating Perfect Security, the exact balance of security and controls with operations and limitations. However, to see security in a new way requires new terminology as well.

A sub-scope of a vector created in order to approach the security testing of a complex scope in an organized manner. It is based on the divide and conquer algorithm design paradigm that consists in recursively breaking Attack Vector down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same (or related) type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. Impact and loss reduction controls. The assurance that the physical and information assets as well as the channels themselves are protected from various types of invalid interactions as defined by the channel. For example, insuring the store in the case of fire is a control that does", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 12}}
