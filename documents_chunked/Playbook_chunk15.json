Fire up a packet sniffer and watch live traffic in different segments. Make sure you know what it all is and whether it should even be there. If you can get a professional tool for constantly monitoring traffic, like a SIEM, even better. Then track down those anomalies. \u0001 Remember: Not all software needs to be updated. \u0001 You should always update if a security patch is necessary and you have no other means of controlling the vulnerability. However, that requires you have the people and time to investigate that. If the updates are for new functionality only, on the other hand, consider whether you really need this new functionality. Many a process has been broken and many a file has been lost because an application or system update made changes you didn’t need or anticipate. As any coach will tell you, if it’s not broken, don’t fix it. So have a process in place to pick and choose which updates get installed. \u0001 Make rounds and talk to employees. \u0001 Get to know what they need to do their jobs, how they interact with third party vendor services, and what software they use regularly. People develop routines and habits at work. They are your best source for knowing when something outside your basic control like cloud services and vendor extranets are not behaving like normal. Forget Strategy, Choose Your Tactics A strategy is an integral part of any modern business plan. So what exactly is a cybersecurity strategy? A cybersecurity strategy is a plan with a set of goals and objectives to achieve cybersecurity as a result. People who are into selling cybersecurity strategies like to say it also includes specifics on tools and metrics. But that’s really just a trick of adding tactics to the strategy so it doesn’t sound so useless. THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 3: LOOKING DOWNFIELD 23 Yes, useless. Fun fact for you — a cybersecurity strategy is useless. The truth is if you don’t have one for your business it’s because you’ve inherently got one already. You’ve never bothered to formally document it because it’s so obvious. Like how you don’t have a formal not dying strategy. If you were to have a formal cybersecurity strategy it would likely say you don’t want threats of any sort affecting your assets of any sort now or in the future. Which is obvious. So if it’s useless, why is there such a focus on a cybersecurity strategy? Because tactics are hard. It’s easier (and safer) to make a cybersecurity strategy sound like something important despite meaning nothing than it is to choose and implement tactics that work. You look better longer, too, because whereas a cybersecurity strategy can go on meaning nothing a really long time tactics that mean nothing get noticed right away. Cybersecurity tactics, meanwhile, are where the rubber meets", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Playbook", "chunk_id": 15}}
