{"text": "strong performance throughout the engagement, effectively thwarting attempts by authenticated attackers to exploit vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting that could potentially compromise the server or application. The application also had proper user access controls in place and showed no signs of an attack surface for authorisation-based attacks. Only low-severity issues were identified that should be resolved to add additional layers of security to the application and further harden it. Full details of each issue as well as recommended remedial actions can be found documented in the Technical Findings section. 3.1 Next Steps A complete writeup of every issue is available in the body of this report. It includes required steps to confirm and replicate each issue, along with recommended remedial actions. Pentest recommend taking time to review the findings before arranging a triage meeting to determine the order of priority for remedial work. As a rule of thumb: • Low and Info Risk Items – Track these within a risk register and discuss remediation versus acceptance. If recommendations within this report are followed Pentest believe that the target’s security posture will improve. 3.2 Caveats Pentest provides no warranty that the target(s) are now free from other defects. Security is an ever- evolving field and consultancy is based on the opinions of the consultant, their understanding of the goals of Report URI as well as their individual experience. The findings of this project are based on a time-limited assessment and by necessity can only focus on approved targets which are in scope. An attacker would not be constrained by either time or scope limits and could circumvent controls which are impractical to assess via structured penetration testing. To appropriately secure assets Pentest encourage a cyclical approach to assessment. Each cycle should include: • Comprehensive Assessment – where a full list of findings is produced with the widest scope possible. • Focused Verification Testing – where solutions to the initial assessment’s findings are verified. Depending on how important the target is to the concerns of Report URI, Pentest recommend repeating the cycle every 6-months or 12-months at least.

The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an industry standard formula. It generates a risk score between 0.0 and 10.0. The table below explains the risk categories and demonstrates rule-of-thumb equivalency with CVSS scores: Risk Category CVSS Score Rationales 8.1 – 10.0 Poses a severe risk which is easy to exploit. Begin the process of remediating immediately after the issue has been presented. 6.1 – 8.0 Poses a significant risk and can be exploited. Address these as soon as possible after any critical risks have been remediated. 4.1 – 6.0 Poses an important risk but may be difficult to exploit. Pentest recommends remedial work within 3 months of discovery. 2.1 – 4.0 Poses a", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Report URI - 2024 Penetration Test Report", "chunk_id": 1}}
