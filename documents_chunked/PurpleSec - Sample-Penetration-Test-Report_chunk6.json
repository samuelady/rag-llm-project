This is intended to simulate a malicious actor attempting to gain credentials and a foothold in the environment by a phone call. 10 phone contacts were made with 3 Full Breach’s with multiple (6) passwords given to the Social Engineer. One contact stated most of the systems use the same password for everyone. Nexus Point Activities: PurpleSec‘s Social Engineer called the numbers over a three-day period and spoke with CLIENT staff members. Each time a live staff member was reached, the Social Engineer claimed to be a technical support worker authorized to contact CLIENT’s personnel to provide critical support. If challenged, the Social Engineer would then drop Information Security Staff member names in a statement that they are working on their behalf. The Social Engineer’s program included the following activities: • Requesting that the user provide his/her domain username. • Feigning an attempt to perform a technical operation on the user’s behalf, and then requested that the user provide his/her domain password when the operation ‘failed.’ Three of the personnel engaged by the Social Engineer provided domain usernames or passwords. The passwords revealed were eight characters long with only alphanumeric characters. Cloud-based servers may be able to break these passwords within a manner of weeks or days depending on the resources allocated to password cracking efforts. PurpleSec recommends increased complexity and length. Risk Rating: MEDIUM Bottom Line: It was found to be feasible to induce CELxIa mple’s users to provide logon information through deceptive telephone communications. Recommendations: • Conduct Social Engineering Training to help staff properly validate the identity of the phone callers and do not provide confidential credential information. • Ensure procedures have employees report unusual or suspicious", "metadata": {"doc_id": "PurpleSec - Sample-Penetration-Test-Report", "chunk_id": 6}}
