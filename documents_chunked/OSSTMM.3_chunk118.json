It may be necessary to coordinate these tests with the appropriate persons within the scope. 11.3.1 Filtering (a) Test whether INCOMING network data or communications over web, instant messaging, chat, web-based forums, or e-mail, are monitored or filtered by an authoritative party for relay of improper materials, code injections, malicious content, and improper conduct and record responses and response time. (b) Test whether OUTGOING network data or communications over web, instant messaging, chat, web-based forums, or e-mail, are monitored or filtered by an authoritative party for relay of improper materials, code injections, malicious content, and improper conduct and record responses and response time. 11.3.2 Active Detection (a) Verify active responses to probes from systems and services. This could be human or machine readable notifications, packet responses, silent alarm trips, or the like. (b) Map any applications, systems, or network segments within the scope which produce logs, alarms, or notifications. This could include Network or Host based Intrusion Detection or Prevention Systems, syslog, Security Information Management tools (SIMs), application logs, and the like.

(b) Use network sniffing to identify emanating protocols from network service responses or requests where applicable. For example, Netbios, ARP, SAP, NFS, BGP, OSPF, MPLS, RIPv2, etc. (c) Query all name servers and the name servers of the ISP or hosting provider, if available, for corresponding A, AAAA, and PTR records as well as ability to perform zone transfers to determine the existence of all targets in the network and any related redundancies, load balancing, caching, proxying, and virtual hosting. (d) Verify broadcast requests and responses from all targets. (e) Verify and examine the use of traffic and routing protocols for all targets. (f) Verify ICMP responses for ICMP types 0-255 and ICMP codes 0-2 from all targets. (g) Verify default and likely SNMP community names in use are according to practical deployments of all SNMP versions. (h) Verify responses from targets to select ports with TTL expiration set to less than 1 and 2 hops from the targets. For example: TCP 8, 22, 23, 25, 80, 443, 445, 1433 UDP 0, 53, 139, 161 ICMP T00:C00, T13:C00, T15:C00, T17:C00 (i) Trace the route of ICMP packets to all targets. (j) Trace the route of TCP packets to all targets for ports SSH, SMTP, HTTP, and HTTPS ports. (k) Trace the route of UDP packets to all targets for DNS and SNMP ports. (l) Identify TCP ISN sequence number predictability for all targets. (m)Verify IPID increments from responses for all targets. (n) Verify the use of Loose Source Routing to the target gateway and outer perimeter systems to route packets to all targets.
