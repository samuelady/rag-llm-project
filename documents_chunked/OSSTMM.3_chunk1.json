{"text": "incompatible. Those with early 3.0 draft rav (prior to RC 12) will require that the values be re-calculated using this final attack surface calculation which is available as a spreadsheet calculator at http://www.isecom.org/ravs. Previous OSSTMM security metrics measured risk with degradation however this version does not. Instead, the focus now is on a metric for the attack surface (the exposure) of a target or scope. This allows for a factual metric that has no bias or opinion like risk does. Our intention is to eventually eliminate the use of risk in areas of security which have no set price value of an asset (like with people, personal privacy, and even fluctuating markets) in favor of trust metrics which are based completely on facts. Much of the terminology has changed in this version to provide a professional definition of that which can actually be created or developed. This is most notable in definitions for security and safety which take more specific and concrete meanings for operations within. Since so much has changed from previous versions, as this is a completely re-written methodology, we recommend you read through it once before using it. Further help is available at http://www.isecom.org. Courses to help you make thorough and proper security tests, systems, and processes are available through ISECOM and will help you get the most of the OSSTMM.
