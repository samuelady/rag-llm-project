{"text": "agitation to create an interaction with the target and passive testing is the recording, aggregation, and analysis of emanations from the target. This methodology requires both active and passive tests. Furthermore, the Analyst may not be able to differentiate between data collected passively from emanations of the operations and that which is the delayed or misdirected response to agitation. The introduction of any outside event, including the passive kind, has the potential to change the nature of the target’s operations and lower the quality of an uninfluenced test on operational security. However, this does not represent a failure of the Analyst or the audit process, but simply an unavoidable evil of testing a system in a stochastic environment over a linear time frame. Simply put, the Analyst often cannot “take back” the agitation once it has been set in motion and any corrections will cause additional and varied results that do not match the aim of the original task. This is important because it will make it difficult to later compare results. It will also mean that prior tests will influence later tests due to the “memory” of the impact of the test. This is very noticeable in testing over the PHYSSEC channel. It is important to note that when harmonizing the OSSTMM with other testing standards, it is important not to constrict the flow of this methodology by introducing standards so formal and unrelenting that the quality of the test suffers.

Scenario 1 The Analyst tests entry into a secured area with false authentication. The guard examines the badge briefly and allows the Analyst to enter. The Analyst performs the audit to the point where the Analyst is identified and the nature of the audit is revealed, if at all. Scenario 2 The Analyst tests entry into a secured area with false authentication. The guard examines the badge briefly and doubting its authenticity, does not allow the Analyst to enter. The Analyst tries additional tactics until entry is gained. The Analyst performs the audit to the point where the Analyst is identified and the nature of the audit is revealed, if at all. In both scenarios 1 and 2, there may or may not be a record of the entry attempt. If there is a record, that record can be re-used either by the Analyst the next time if the badge is denied as proof of its authenticity or by the guard who may be doubting its authenticity and wants to see what other guards have done. For the next audit, the Analyst may try the same badge again, attempt other means to gain entry through social engineering techniques, or try using a different badge.
