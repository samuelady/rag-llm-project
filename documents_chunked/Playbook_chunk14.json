{"text": "regularly on how to react when things go wrong. Only with exercises can you assure that despite fear, confusion, or fatigue, the default reaction is the secure one. \u0001 Create an incident response plan and drill it. \u0001 Create an emergency checklist employees can use and keep practicing walking through it until everyone is clear on how they should react. Include all new hires in the drills from their first day. \u0001 Get employees used to dealing with attacks. \u0001 Plan regular security exercises designed to manipulate employees such as mock phishing attacks, social engineering in person and on the phone, and fake malware activity. \u0001 Give mandatory security challenges and puzzles. \u0001 These should take no more than a couple minutes to complete and are designed to be done without taking employees completely out of their day-to-day tasks. This trains employees to think security while doing their normal activities since nobody has the luxury to stop working during real attacks. Equipment In many sports, being the better athlete doesn’t guarantee a win on its own. The difference between first and second place can often come down to the equipment. New materials, new technology, and new designs can give you a critical advantage. \u0001 Make the most of your tech. \u0001 In cybersecurity, having better routers increases response times, better processors allow for stronger encryption protocols, and more elastic monitoring solutions reduce the need to spread out resources. \u0001 Consider the cloud. \u0001 Cloud-based services can provide you with additional functionality you don’t have to build or manage on your own. There’s a trade-off in terms of control and self-sufficiency, of course, but the added capabilities can allow you to do more with less. \u0001 Even when you can’t allocate resources on new equipment, you need to maintain the old. \u0001 Sometimes just upgrading components like RAM and hard disks is enough to make a difference. \u0001 Keep your systems running lean. \u0001 Stick to necessary software as much as possible, minimizing the memory resident and memory-hungry software that can slowly grind a system to a halt. THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 3: LOOKING DOWNFIELD 22 Environment Some athletes compete on clay, some on dirt, some on grass, and others on artificial surfaces like artificial turf or asphalt. What they all have in common is that they’ve honed their game to adapt to that environment and they’ve cultivated a home field advantage by learning how to outcompete others on it accordingly. You need to do the same by getting to know your own environment by actively maintaining it and understanding even the littlest changes. \u0001 Know what “normal” looks like. \u0001 Make a routine of examining the protocols on the network, the systems that interact with each other, the ways the employees use their desktops, and how mobile devices operate in this environment. Fire up a packet sniffer and watch live traffic in different segments. Make sure you know what it all is and whether it should even be there.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Playbook", "chunk_id": 14}}
