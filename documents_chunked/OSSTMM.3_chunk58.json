{"text": "into an Attack Surface Measurement Operational Security The measurement of the Attack Surface requires the measurements of Visibility, Trust, and Access relative to the scope. The number of targets in the scope that can be determined to exist by direct interaction, indirect interaction, or passive emanations is its visibility. As visibility is determined, its value represents the number of targets in the scope. Trust is any non-authenticated interaction to any of the targets. Access is the number of interaction points with each target. Category Description The number of targets in the scope. Count all targets by index only once and maintain the index consistently for all targets. It is generally unrealistic to have more targets visible than there are targets in the defined scope; however, it may be possible due to vector bleeds where a target which is normally not visible from one vector is visible due to a misconfiguration or 1 Visibility anomaly. A HUMSEC audit employs 50 people; however, only 38 of them are interactive from the test vector and channel. This would make a visibility of 38. This differs from visibility where one is determining the number of existing targets. Here, the auditor must count each Access per unique interaction point per unique probe. In a PHYSSEC audit, a building with 2 doors and 5 windows which all open has an Access of 7. If all the doors and windows are sealed, then it is an Access of 0 as these are not points where one can gain entry. For a COMSEC audit of data networks, the auditor counts each port response as an Access regardless of how many different ways the auditor can probe that port. However, if a service is not hosted at that port (daemon or an application), then all replies instead come from the IP Stack. Therefore, a server that responds with a SYN/ACK and service 2 Access interactivity to only one of the TCP ports scanned and with a RST to the rest does not have an Access count of 65536 (including port 0) since 66535 of the ports respond with the same response of RST from the kernel. To simplify, count only ports with service responses and only one IP Stack response regardless of the number of ports which can initiate this kind of interactivity. With HUMSEC audits, this is much more simplified. A person who responds to a query counts as an Access with all types of queries (all the different questions you may ask or statements made count as the same type of response on the same channel). Therefore, a person can only be an Access of 1 per channel and vector. Only a person who completely ignores the request by not acknowledging the channel is not counted.
