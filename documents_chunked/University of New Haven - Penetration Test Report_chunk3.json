Page 3\\n2 Observations This section serves as a high level overview of the security posture of AEC. A detailed list of all discovered vulnerabilities can be found in Section 4. It is important to note that this list is by no means exhaustive and that there are most likely vulnerabilities that New Haven Hacking Inc. did not find. Improper Authentication Misconfigurations 1 3 Vulnerabilities 1 2 2 Default Credentials Data Exposures 2 Network Design Figure 1: Summary of Issues within the Network Default Credentials & Lack of authentication The most immediate observation about AEC’s security posture is that default, null, and passwordless authentication was discovered on multiple systems. New Haven Hacking Inc. was able to gain access into a SCADA system using the same credentials (which were default) as the last engagement. The system in question is critical to the storage, delivery, and packaging processes within the warehouse facility. Moreover, several databases contained this same issue and were found to not be requiring password authentication. It is important to remember these credentials are for critical services and PII. These weaknesses can have an enormous impact on AEC’s ability to operate if discovered by threat actors. These vulnerabilities can be remediated with low cost and have an outsized impact on the security of AEC. More details on mitigation for vulnerabilities such as these can be found in each vulnerability’s remediation suggestions in Section 4. Page 4\\n2.1 Summary of Recommendations The following is an overview of recommendations which should be implemented: • Resolve any PCI DSS compliance violations in Section 2.3.1 and ensure that AEC is currently meeting all documentation requirements set by PCI DSS. • Implement both ingress & egress filtering to reduce attack surface on hosts. • Ensure all hosts use least privilege principals to reduce attack surface. • Ensure proper encryption is used for confidential data (e.g. passwords and card holder data). • Implementation of a strong password policy. • Implement Multi-Factor authentication to provide defense in depth in addition to pass- words. • Uses centralized logging to be able to respond to potential incidents faster. • Ensure null or password-less authentication is not allowed. • Ensure only necessary services are running within the subnet. 2.2 Positive Security Measures As the engagement progressed, New Haven Hacking Inc. was impeded by the security safe- guards AEC had in place. A number of basic security best practices were observed that limited New Haven Hacking Inc.’s ability to move through the network. Some instances of aforementioned security practices implemented by AEC include: • The usage", "metadata": {"doc_id": "University of New Haven - Penetration Test Report", "chunk_id": 3}}
