{"text": "should you choose to work within the context of notifying the manufacturer, you will need to give them ample time to address the problem before making it public. There is a valid argument that the vulnerability may already be known in criminal circles and need immediate attention. Therefore should you choose to publish without the manufacturer’s assistance, do note that including a fix will also show legally that you had good intentions and much of the legal system focuses on implied intent. Your choice depends on whether frivolous lawsuits are accepted or prevalent in your region. Remember, it is not you the Analyst who is required to do the quality assurance testing for the manufacturer therefore you do not owe them any information from work you’ve done even if it includes their product. Full disclosure is helpful as long as it can do no human, physical harm. Furthermore, consumers should not have to wait on manufacturer fixes for their products to be secure. If the product is not sold as a security specific solution then it’s up to the consumers to make it secure and safe, or not use it. If it is sold as secure and safe then it is up to the manufacturer to fix it however, the consumer may not want to wait until the manufacturer can do so. Full disclosure allows for this choice.

This requires understanding more than just the information but also where it came from, how and when it was collected, and any constraints of the collection process. The final part of the analysis process is to create actionable intelligence, information derived from fact that can be used to make decisions. This is the clear distinction between security and risk analysis. In security analysis, you produce facts even if that fact states something can’t be known from the information provided. In risk analysis, you speculate and derive opinions based on information. Risk analysis can use security analysis to come up with better, more accurate answers however security analysis cannot use risk analysis to improve accuracy. For this reason we recommend trust analysis. Analyzing the Security of Everything The fundamental difference between doing a risk analysis versus a security analysis is that in security analysis you never analyze the threat. This is because assuming you know what threats exist, when they may hit, how they will come, and where they will go is something reserved for risk analysis. In security analysis, you study and measure the attack surface of and around a target. This will allow you then to understand where the threats, any threats, can attack if they do attack. For example, consider a long, high wall. The risk analysis will consider", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 40}}
