{"text": "order to be secure, the asset is removed from the Security threat or the threat is removed from the asset. This manual covers security from an operational perspective, verifying security measures in an operating or live environment. The rav is a scale measurement of an attack surface, the amount of uncontrolled interactions with a target, which is calculated by the quantitative balance between porosity, limitations, and controls. In this scale, 100 rav (also sometimes shown as 100% rav) is perfect balance and Rav anything less is too few controls and therefore a greater attack surface. More than 100 rav shows more controls than are necessary which itself may be a problem as controls often add interactions within a scope as well as complexity and maintenance issues. That within the scope that you are attacking, which is comprised of the Target asset and any protections the asset may have. The direction of an interaction. Vector One classification of Limitation where a person or process can access, deny access to others, or hide itself or assets within the scope.

Either the separation between an asset and any threats exists or it does not. There are 3 logical and proactive ways to create this separation: 1. Move the asset to create a physical or logical barrier between it and the threats. 2. Change the threat to a harmless state. 3. Destroy the threat. When analyzing the state of security we can see where there is the possibility for interaction and where there is not. We know some, all, or even none of these interactions may be required for operations. Like doors into a building, some of the doors are needed for customers and others for workers. However, each door is an interactive point which can increase both necessary operations and unwanted ones, like theft. Since the security tester may not know at this point the business justification for all these interactive points, we refer to this as the porosity. The porosity reduces the separation between a threat and an access. It is further categorized as one of 3 elements, visibility, access, or trust which describes its function in operations which further allows the proper controls to be added during the remediation phase of improving protection. So consider that if the separation exists properly from the threats, such as a man inside a mountain avoiding lightning, then that security is true; it is 100%. For every hole in the mountain, every means for lightning to cause harm to that man, the porosity increases as an Access. Each point of interaction reduces the security below 100%, where 100% represents a full separation. Therefore, the increase in porosity is the decrease in security and each pore is either a Visibility, Access, or Trust.
