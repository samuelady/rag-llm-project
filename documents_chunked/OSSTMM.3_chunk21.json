{"text": "as well as being mapped to this interactive class of controls. A concern can only be found in Class B Controls however can impact OpSec therefore it is mapped to all OpSec parameters as well as being mapped to this process class of controls. An exposure gives us intelligence about the interaction with a target and thus maps directly to Visibility and Access. This intelligence can also help an attacker navigate around some or all controls and so Exposure is also mapped to both Control classes. Finally, Exposure has no value itself unless there is a way to use this intelligence to exploit the asset or a Control and so Vulnerabilities, Weaknesses and Concerns also play a role in the weighting of Exposure’s value. An anomaly is any unidentifiable or unknown element which has not been controlled and cannot be accounted for in normal operations. The fact that it has not been controlled and cannot be accounted for signifies a direct link with Trust. This Limitation can also cause anomalies in the way Controls function and so they are also included in the weighting. Finally, as with an Exposure, an Anomaly alone does not affect OpSec without the existence of either a Vulnerability, Weakness or Concern which can exploit this unusual behavior. Additionally, more than one category can apply to a limitation when the flaw breaks OpSec in more than Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution-Non-Commercial-NoDerivs 2010, ISECOM, www.isecom.org, www.osstmm.org 29\\none place. For example, an Authentication control which allows a person to hijack another person’s credentials has a Weakness and should the credentials allow Access then it also has a Vulnerability. In another example, an Authentication control uses a common list of names corresponding to e-mail addresses. Every address which can be found or guessed and used as a log-in is an Exposure while the control itself has a Weakness for its inability to identify the correct user of the Authentication mechanism of the log-in. If any of those credentials allow Access then we include this as a Vulnerability as well. Justification for Limitations The concept that limitations are only limitations if they have no business justification is false. A limitation is a limitation if it behaves in one of the limiting factors as described here. A justification for a limitation is a risk decision that is met with either a control of some kind or merely acceptance of the limitation. Risk decisions that accept the limitations as they are often come down to: the damage a limitation can cause does not justify the cost to fix or control the limitation, the limitation must remain according to legislation, contracts, or policy, or a conclusion that the threat does not exist or is unlikely for this particular limitation. Since risk justifications are not a part of calculating an attack surface, all limitations discovered must still be counted within the attack surface regardless if best practice, common practice, or legal practice denotes it as not a risk.
