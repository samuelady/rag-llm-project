{"text": "set at 100 and calculations are made in respect to that. This will allow most people to have a quick and easy overview of all the targets in a scope or of just a single target in relation to other targets. It is extremely flexible so multiple attack surfaces can be compared by Actual Security even if the scope or the targets are very different: 95% rav of a scope with 1000 computer systems is comparable to 95% rav with just 10 systems, which can be again compared to a building with a 95% rav. All three will provide the same information to a person that the protection of the target is 5% deficient and therefore exposed to attack. With this knowledge, one can begin to assess risk and determine what is exposed, what is left uncontrolled, and if that 5% is acceptable. So for whatever threat there is, it can only occur where the openings are and that will sharpen the exactness of a risk analysis from broad sword to scalpel.

A rav is a little different from other security measurements because the count is unique from the scope. That is like determining the overall size of a person by counting all the cells in them and categorizing them by what they do to determine the person’s overall health. For a rav, both the count and the operation are required. This is why the rav can only be derived from operational security testing. Imagine a machine exists that can audit all the cells in a human body. This machine works by monitoring the cells in their environment and even prodding each cell in a way it can react to better categorize its purpose. We could then see what various cells do and how they contribute to the overall make-up of the human body. Some cells make up tissue walls like skin cells do. Some, like white blood cells, provide authentication and attack other cells which are on its “bad” list. Then some cells are foreigners, like bacteria which have entered at some point and thrived. The machine would classify all the cells that make up the person, a defined scope, rather than say which are “bad” or “good”. By counting the cells the machine can tell mostly how well the person as an organism works (health) and how well they fit into their current environment. It can also determine which cells are broken, which are superfluous, and of which type more might be required for the person to be more efficient, prepared for the unexpected, or for any number of specific requirements. Since the cells are dividing and dying all the time, the machine must also make regular tests and chart the person’s ability to improve or at least maintain homeostasis. Now in addition to counting cells and seeing how they work, the machine will also see with which other cells or under what conditions they", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 52}}
