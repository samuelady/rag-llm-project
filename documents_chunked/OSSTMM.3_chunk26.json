While a thorough security audit requires testing all five channels, realistically, tests are conducted and categorized by the required expertise of the Analyst and the required equipment for the audit.

Physical security testing where the channel is both Physical Security physical and non-electronic in nature. Comprises the (PHYSSEC) tangible element of security where interaction Physical requires physical effort or an energy transmitter to manipulate. Comprises all electronic communications, signals, and emanations which take place over the known Spectrum Security EM spectrum. This includes ELSEC as electronic Wireless (SPECSEC) communications, SIGSEC as signals, and EMSEC which are emanations untethered by cables. Comprises all telecommunication networks, digital or analog, where interaction takes place over Telecommunications established telephone or telephone-like network lines. Communications Comprises all electronic systems and data networks Security (COMSEC) where interaction takes place over established cable Data Networks and wired network lines. Data Networks While the channels and their divisions may be represented in any way, within this manual they are organized as recognizable means of communication and interaction. This organization is designed to facilitate the test process while minimizing the inefficient overhead that is often associated with strict methodologies.

Some tests will test the tester’s skill more than actually testing the security of a target. Do note when reporting the audit, there is often a requirement to identify exactly the type of audit performed. Too often, audits based on different test types are compared to track the delta (deviations) from an established baseline of the scope. If the precise test type is not available to a third-party reviewer or regulator, the audit itself should be considered a Blind test, which is one with the least merit towards a thorough security test.

The target is prepared for the audit, knowing in advance all the details of the audit. A blind audit primarily tests the skills of the Analyst. The breadth and depth 1 Blind of a blind audit can only be as vast as the Analyst’s applicable knowledge and efficiency allows. In COMSEC and SPECSEC, this is often referred to as Ethical Hacking and in the PHYSSEC class, this is generally scripted as War Gaming or Role Playing. The Analyst engages the target with no prior knowledge of its defenses, assets, or channels. The target is not notified in advance", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 26}}
