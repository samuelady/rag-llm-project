{"text": "from. Therefore, what is needed is a defense designed to protect an environment where in each individual can be interacting and interconnecting with everyone and everything. The Möbius Defense does this in three steps: 1. Improving verification and analysis: verify and analyze operations for interactions and controls and not just flaws. 2. Establishing defense in width: apply defensive tactics to balance the controls of all interactions with operations. 3. Implementing a trust strategy: compartmentalize how interactions are authorized or controlled. 1. Improving Verification and Analysis The practice of verifying operational security must include more than just finding flaws. There needs to be a better accounting for and understanding of errors that will make tests inaccurate. There needs to be an improvement in test accuracy through a better understanding of what to test and when to test it. Increasing the accuracy of test results will serve to both provide results that can be repeated and results which can be used to make consistent measurements. The security test must catalog and classify all points of interaction, determine which controls exist for those interactions, and verify the functionality of those controls. Flaws within the scope or the controls must be classified by how they affect operations and not the possible or potential risk they pose to operations. The security test must also track that which was not tested and which tests were not performed to assure repeatability and fair comparisons with past and future tests. Finally, the testing Analyst must be capable of properly understanding the results of the test and what they mean for operations. The means to do all of this are provided within this manual. 2. Establishing Defense in Width The main concept behind a Möbius Defense is to provide Defense in Width and a balanced variety of controls to each interactive point. A perfect balance is achieved with the flawless application of all ten types of operational controls for each interactive point. This differs from Defense in Depth by assuring different types of controls applied to all interactive points rather than just any controls at various points within a process. With new information from the security test, a defensive posture can be created by verifying that a balance of controls exists at all points of interaction. This changes the environment in which inter-connectivity occurs, and curtails the possible operational changes caused by chaotic elements either inside or outside. The balance of controls is important because each control can add to the attack surface of an operation. Assuring a balance also assures that different types of controls are used which provide protection in different ways. This increases the range of attack types and problems that the interactive point can be defended against. The ravs are to be used to measure the amount of balance attained and to assure balance is maintained as new operations are introduced to the scope. This manual covers all the information required to build Defense in Width.
