{"text": "new solutions and processes can be justified regularly as well as the cost of maintaining the current security level. 6. How do we know if we are reducing our exposure to our threats? With specific knowledge of your controls, you can easily tell what part or vector of the scope is weak to specific and most unknown threats. In rav terminology, an unknown threat is just one that can appear where interactions exist but controls do not. Therefore a map can be drawn between the threats determined by the Risk Assessors and the controls in place. Regular metric reviews will show any change in this map and can be done so regularly. Then it is possible to gauge the cost each of those threats has on security by the expenditure on controls. 7. Can the rav tell us how well something resists attacks? Technically, yes. The more you can balance controls with interactions, the smaller the attack surface will be and the more capable the target will have to control known and unknown types of interactions. 8. Can the rav help me with regulatory compliance? Anything that helps you classify all controls and Access points in a scope will help you with compliance audits. The rav helps you do such a good job of getting your security under control that you may even find the major flaws in compliance regulations. While there is no particular compliance right now that asks you to have a particular rav score, showing the OSSTMM STAR with its rav score will help you meet various compliance requirements for a third-party audit and documentation.

Any security test can be used but the more thorough and accurate the test the more the conclusive the results will be. The rav was originally designed for operations tests, like the OSSTMM, where the auditor focuses on the behavior of the target rather than the configuration. However experiments show it is possible to apply the rav to non-operational tests as well such as in static code analysis to determine the level of software security and complexity or in physical security checklist audits to determine the level of protection a physical space will provide. The SCARE (Source Code Analysis Risk Evaluation) project does exactly this by applying the ravs to C source code. The simplicity of making a rav from a security test. The minimum rav is made by the calculation of porosity which are the holes in the scope. The problem with security metrics is generally in the determination of the assessors to count what they canâ€™t possibly really know. This problem does not exist in the rav. You get what you know from what is there for a particular vector and you make no assumptions surrounding what is not there. You count all that which is visible", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 55}}
