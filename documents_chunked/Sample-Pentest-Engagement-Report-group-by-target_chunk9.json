{"text": "hp Method GET Vulnerable Parameter redirect (Query Parameter) Evidence The server redirects to the URL https://pentest- tools.com/file.txt when it is injected in the redirect query parameter. Request / Response Vulnerability description We noticed that the target application's backend server directly incorporates user input into URLs that it uses for redirection without adequate validation. This behavior creates an open redirect vulnerability, which can lead users to arbitrary, potentially malicious domains. Risk description The risk is that attackers may use open redirect to redirect users to arbitrary domains of their choice. This can be used in phishing attacks, as targets will receive a trusted URL and might not notice the subsequent redirect. 40\\nRecommendation If possible, the application should not incorporate user input into URLs. Instead, use direct links to redirect towards the target page. If, however, this is not possible, you should only accept relative URLs as input. To check that the input represents a relative URL, make sure that it starts with a \"/\". If this check passes, prepend your domain name to it, and use this final result as the redirection URL.

We modified its initial value info.php?id=2 to info.php?id=1 and the two responses were 96% similar. The parameter may introduce an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability. Request / Response Vulnerability description We identified a parameter that uses numerical values to access resources, potentially leading to Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) vulnerabilities. Risk description The vulnerability allows attackers to brute-force parameter values to uncover and access unauthorized resources and functionalities. Recommendation Ensure that parameter values would not reveal sensitive information and that the application properly checks the user's authorization to access the resource. Also, the resource IDs should not be predictable.
