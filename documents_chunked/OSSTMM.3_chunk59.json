Here, the auditor must count each Trust per unique interaction point per unique probe. In a PHYSSEC audit, a building with 2 internal doors separating rooms which open has a Trust of 2. If those doors are sealed then it is a Trust of 0 as these are not points where one can pass. 3 Trust For a COMSEC audit of data networks, the auditor counts each type of service forward or port forward as a Trust. With HUMSEC audits, a person who acts as a gateway to interact with other people or to access property is a trust per channel. Therefore, a person can only be a Trust of 1 per channel and vector. Only a person who does not comply to the Trust request is not counted.

Category Description Count each instance of authentication required to gain access. This requires that authorization and identification make up the process for the proper use of the authentication mechanism. 1 Authentication In a PHYSSEC audit, if both a special ID card and a thumb print scan is required to gain access, then add two for authentication. However, if Access just requires one or the other, then only count one. Count each instance of methods used to exact liability and insure compensation for all assets within the scope. A basic PHYSSEC example is a warning sign threatening to prosecute trespassers. Another common example is property insurance. In a scope 2 Indemnification of 200 computers, a blanket insurance policy against theft applies to all 200 and therefore is a count of 200. However, do not confuse the method with the flaw in the method. A threat to prosecute without the ability or will to prosecute is still an indemnification method-- however, it is with a limitation. Count each instance for Access or Trust in the scope which strictly does not allow for controls to follow user discretion or originate outside of itself. This differs from being a security limitation in the target since it applies to the design or implementation of controls. In a COMSEC data networks audit, if a log-in can be made in HTTP as well as HTTPS but requires the user to make that distinction, then it fails to count toward Subjugation. However, if the implementation requires the secured mode by default, such as a PKI internal messaging system, then it does 3 Subjugation meet the requirement of the Subjugation control for that scope. More simply, in HUMSEC, a non-repudiation process where the person must sign a register and provide an identification number to receive a document is under Subjugation controls when the provider", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 59}}
