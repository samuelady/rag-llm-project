Implementing a Trust Strategy To know which interactions require less balance than others from Defense in Width is a matter of knowing which interactions we should trust. For the operations we have less reason to trust, we should apply more of the ten controls to achieve perfect balance. Individuals we have less reason to trust we place in environments where all interactions are protected by more of the ten controls. Conversely, trustworthy individuals can be authorized to have more individual control over the interactions in their environment. Finally we should separate elements from the environment when no significant reason to trust or benefit to the operation can be found in those elements. Doing so will also keep Defense in Width within a reasonable scale of operations so that efficiency and expense do not outweigh the benefits of protection. The trust metrics provided within this manual assure that the reasons to trust are based on facts. As the reasons to trust approach 100% we are not only certain that the individual or the operation are incapable of malicious or accidental damage but that it has been proven. This is no risk assessment or guess based on what we know from our “own little world.” The difficulty in this process however may be in assigning trust metrics to people. Unlike the informal and almost capricious way trust is often assigned, this new manner may seem cold and heartless. But it isn’t because while you are investigating what reasons you have to trust someone you are also able to fully inform them of what they can do to give you more reason to trust them. The typical means of trusting or not trusting is not so specific, nor is it so kind. It is more of a social game of being likeable or not to the person providing the authorization. The trust metrics are more transparent and more neutral aside from how someone feels based on their “own little world.” The trust metrics can even be verified by others, such as a board or a department, who can maintain the trust calculations neutrally and re-assess regularly or whenever it’s necessary. Get What We Need The application of the Möbius Defense has many ramifications. First, it assures that the results of security tests are the facts. It assures that the tests have been thorough and based on the processes of operations and not the skills of the Analyst. This provides an organization with an incredible amount of intelligence over their own operations for comparisons with other organizations, or even just trending self assessments. It is the kind of information that decisions require, and that which foster significant operational improvements.
