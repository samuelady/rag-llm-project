{"text": "segmentation controls are implemented, testing of the controls is required to confirm that the segmentation methods are working as intended and that all out-of-scope systems and networks are isolated from systems in the CDE. The scope of segmentation testing should consider any networks and systems considered as being out of scope for PCI DSS to verify they do not have connectivity to the CDE and cannot be used to impact the security of the CDE. The intent of this assessment is to validate the effectiveness of the segmentation controls separating the out-of-scope environments from the CDE and to ensure the controls are operating as intended. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

PCI DSS provides examples of critical systems that may be impacted by identified vulnerabilities including “security systems, public-facing devices and systems, databases, and other systems that store, process, or transmit cardholder data” (Requirement 6.1). However, for the purposes of a penetration test, there may be additional systems outside the CDE boundaries that could affect the security of the CDE. These systems should also be considered to be critical systems. Common examples of critical systems relevant to a penetration test might include: security systems (for example, firewalls, intrusion-detection systems/intrusion-prevention systems (IDS/IPS), authentication servers, e- commerce redirection servers, etc.), or any assets utilized by privileged users to support and manage the CDE. Please note that critical systems are defined by the entity, as each environment is different. 2.3 Application-Layer and Network-Layer Testing Any software written by or specifically for the organization that is part of the penetration test scope should be subject to both an application and network-layer penetration test. This assessment helps identify security defects that result from either insecure application design or configuration, or from employing insecure coding practices or security defects that may result from insecure implementation, configuration, usage, or maintenance of software. The remediation of vulnerabilities identified during an application-layer assessment may involve redesigning or rewriting insecure code. The remediation of vulnerabilities identified during a network-layer assessment typically involves either reconfiguring or updating software. In some instances, remediation may include deploying a secure alternative to insecure software. 2.3.1 Authentication If the application requires user authentication to the custom software, testing should be performed against all roles or types of access assumed by these parties. Also, testing should be performed against any role or access type that does not have explicit authorization to cardholder data to verify accounts without access cannot compromise such data. For customers running applications on multitenant servers that provide customers access to their cardholder data, authenticated testing should be performed to ensure customer access is properly restricted to only their own cardholder data. The customer should provide the penetration tester with credentials that have equivalent permission(s) as a customer user, to allow the penetration tester to determine whether those", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Penetration-Testing-Guidance-v1_1", "chunk_id": 5}}
