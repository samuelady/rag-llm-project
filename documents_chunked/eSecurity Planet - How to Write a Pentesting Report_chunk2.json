{"text": "the pen test report writer will create a vulnerability report. All major vulnerabilities will be listed and detailed within the key findings section, with backup information that explains: Vulnerability name, standardized if possible Location of the vulnerability (list of systems, apps, etc.) Technique used to find the vulnerability Proof of concept, or an explanation of how the vulnerability was actually exploited or might have been exploited Likelihood of exploitation within the context of the organization and current trends Potential impact of the exploit directly to affected systems and indirectly if there are cascading effects to security or operations Overall risk assessment based on the nature of the vulnerability, ease of exploit, likelihood of exploit, and impact to the security stack and the overall business impact Recommendations, at a high level, to eliminate or mitigate the vulnerability While this appears second in the report, it will be one of the last sections drafted, as the Key Findings will be extracted from the Full Penetration Test Results. This section should contain only the high-risk vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. Low-risk vulnerabilities can be listed in a table or graph in this section but details on less important vulnerabilities should be left for the Penetration Test Results section. For clients that do not wish to use the penetration testing team for remediation, a high-level list of potential remediations should be used that explains possible solutions. A short recommendation such as “upgrade to version 10.x” will often be sufficient, but should also consider the context of the business environment. For example, a Windows XP machine maintained to run critical industrial equipment will be highly vulnerable and easily exploited. However, a recommendation to simply replace the old computer with a Windows 11 machine will be useless to the client that can only use Windows XP with that equipment. If the client has contracted for remediation or if this is an internal penetration testing report, recommendations may need to be quite involved and include prices for various options, timelines, and labor requirements. In some cases this might merit a separate Remediation Section. Engagement Summary The Engagement Summary can be the first section written because it comes from the statement of work. This section provides the context for the full penetration test results to follow and should outline both the original terms of engagement as well as any added requirements or limitations introduced in the course of the testing. This section should include: The scope of the testing, including IP addresses, systems, applications, exclusions, etc. The timeline, including dates of testing and times (if limited) for testing specific resources (example: only test the web application between 10pm and 11pm weekdays) Security defenses tested Assumptions Standards applied to testing, such as PTES standard for networks, OWASP for applications Compliance standards considered in the testing Full Pen Test Results The Full Pen Test Results section includes all details for all testing performed. Instead of focusing on vulnerabilities, this section will focus on a system-by-system and test-by-test review of", "metadata": {"doc_id": "eSecurity Planet - How to Write a Pentesting Report", "chunk_id": 2}}
