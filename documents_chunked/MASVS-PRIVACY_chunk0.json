Thank you for contributing! - The OWASP MAS team - Introduction Mobile applications frequently access sensitive user data to deliver their core functionalities. This data ranges from personally identifiable information (PII), health metrics, location data, to device identifiers. Mobile devices are a constant companion to users, always connected, and equipped with numerous sensors—including cameras, microphones, GPS and BLE—that generate data capable of inferring user behavior and even identifying individuals. The landscape is further complicated by advanced tracking techniques, the integration of third-party SDKs, and a heightened awareness of privacy issues among users and regulators. As a response, there's a growing trend towards on-device processing to keep user data localized and more secure. It's crucial to protect this data both to gain the trust of users and to comply with global privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the U.S., and similar legislation being considered by governments and regulators around the world. With data becoming a valuable asset for many businesses, apps frequently incorporate third-party tools, such as Software Development Kits (SDKs), to analyze user activity or display ads. These tools can sometimes collect and share data with other companies, often without the clear knowledge or consent of the user. Beyond that, many of these third-party tools monetize the collected data by building services on top of it. They can also create separate data intelligence offerings, such as analytics databases, further enriching their own ecosystem at the expense of user privacy. While making sure the app handles data securely—ensuring its confidentiality, integrity, and availability—is a basic step for an effective data protection strategy (addressed by other categories of the current OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS) such as MASVS-STORAGE, MASVS-CRYPTO, or MASVS-NETWORKING), it's distinct from the broader concept of data privacy. Data security focuses on safeguarding data from unauthorized access, while data privacy emphasizes the rights of users and how data is collected, processed, stored, and shared. This category takes the OWASP MASVS a step further, looking deeper into the challenges of adding\\nused, stored, and shared in a way that respects user privacy and conforms to best practices. It does so by following a “privacy by design and by default” approach, accentuating core principles like data minimization, unlinkability, transparency, and intervenability. Scope The main goal of MASVS-PRIVACY is to provide a baseline for user privacy. It is not intended to cover all aspects of user privacy, especially when other standards and regulations such as ENISA or the GDPR already do that. We focus on the app itself, looking at what can be tested using information that's publicly available or found within the app through methods like static or dynamic analysis. While some associated tests can be automated, others necessitate manual intervention due to the nuanced nature of privacy. For example, if an app collects data that it didn't mention in", "metadata": {"doc_id": "MASVS-PRIVACY", "chunk_id": 0}}
