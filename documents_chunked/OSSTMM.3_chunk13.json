{"text": "be solved directly. Impact and loss reduction controls. The assurance that the physical and information assets as well as the channels themselves are protected from various types of invalid interactions as defined by the channel. For example, insuring the store in the case of fire is a control that does not prevent the inventory from getting damaged or stolen but will pay out Controls equivalent value for the loss. Ten controls have been defined. The first five controls are Class A and control interactions. The five Class B controls are relevant to controlling procedures. See section 1.2 below for further information regarding controls. This is the current state of perceived and known limits for channels, operations, and controls as verified within the audit. Limitation types are classified by how they interact with security and safety on an operational level. Therefore, opinions as to impact, availability in the wild, difficulty to perform, and complexity are not used to classify them. For example, an old rusted lock used to secure the gates of the store at closing time has an imposed security limitation providing a fraction of the protection strength Limitations necessary to delay or withstand an attack. Determining that the lock is old and weak through visual verification is referred to as an identified limitation. Determining it is old and weak by breaking it using 100 kg of force when a successful deterrent requires 1000 kg of force shows a verified limitation. One of its limitations is then classified based on the consequence of the operational action, which in this case is Access. Operations are the lack of security one must have to be interactive, useful, public, open, or available. For example, limiting how a person buys goods Operations or services from a store over a particular channel, such as one door for going in and out, is a method of security within the store’s operations. The exact balance of security and controls with operations and limitations. Perfect Security All interactive points, operations, which are categorized as a Visibility, Porosity Access, or Trust.

In order to be safe, the controls must be in place to assure the threat itself or the effects of the threat are minimized to an acceptable level by the asset Safety owner or manager. This manual covers safety as “controls” which are the means to mitigate attacks in an operational or live environment. A form of protection where a separation is created between the assets and the threat. This includes but is not limited to the elimination of either the asset or the threat. In order to be secure, the asset is removed from the Security threat or the threat is removed from the asset. This manual covers security from an operational perspective, verifying security measures in an operating or live environment.
