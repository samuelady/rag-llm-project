(b) Document the depth of the recorded interaction and the process of identification. (c) Verify that all methods of interaction are properly recorded with proper identification. (d) Identify methods of identification which defeat repudiation. 10.7.2 Confidentiality (a) Enumerate all interactions with services within the scope for communications or assets transported over the channel using secured lines, encryption, “quieted” or “closed” interactions to protect the confidentiality of the information property between the involved parties. (b) Verify the acceptable methods used for confidentiality. (c) Test the strength and design of the encryption or obfuscation methods. (d) Verify the outer limits of communication which can be protected via the applied method of confidentiality. 10.7.3 Privacy Enumerate all interactions with services within the scope for communications or assets transported over the channel using secured lines, encryption, “quieted” or “closed” interactions to protect the privacy of the interaction and the process of providing assets only to those within the proper security clearance for that process, communication, or asset. 10.7.4 Integrity Enumerate and test for inadequacies of integrity where using a documented process, signatures, encryption, hash, or markings to assure that the asset cannot be changed, switched, redirected, or reversed without it being known to parties involved.

(b) Verify the legality and appropriateness of the language in the disclaimers. (c) Verify the effect of the disclaimers upon security or safety measures. (d) Examine the language of the insurance policy for limitations on types of damages or assets. (e) Compare cultural access policy with indemnification policy for evidence of weaknesses.
