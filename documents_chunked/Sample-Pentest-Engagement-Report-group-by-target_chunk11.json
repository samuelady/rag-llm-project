This header is particularly important for preventing Internet Explorer from reinterpreting the content of a web page (MIME-sniffing) and thus overriding the value of the Content-Type header. Risk description The risk is that lack of this header could make possible attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting or phishing in Internet Explorer browsers. Recommendation We recommend setting the X-Content-Type-Options header such as X-Content- Type-Options: nosniff.

The CSP header is a security measure that instructs web browsers to enforce specific security rules, effectively preventing the exploitation of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Risk description The risk is that if the target application is vulnerable to XSS, lack of this header makes it easily exploitable by attackers. Recommendation Configure the Content-Security-Header to be sent with each HTTP response in order to apply the specific policies needed by the application.

Request / Response Vulnerability description We noticed that the target application's server responses lack the Referrer-Policy HTTP header, which controls how much referrer information the browser will send with each request originated from the current web application. Risk description The risk is that if a user visits a web page (e.g. \"http://example.com/pricing/\") and clicks on a link from that page going to e.g. \"https://www.google.com\", the browser will send to Google the full originating URL in the Referer header, assuming the Referrer-Policy header is not set.
