The post-execution phase focused on analyzing the identified vulnerabilities to determine root causes, establish recommendations and/or remediation activities, and develop a final report where all vulnerabilities noted during the test were documented even though the vulnerabilities did not have an impact on the cardholder data environment. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 29\\nThe penetration test report was presented to the Client and it was discussed how the Client could remediate the vulnerabilities noted during the penetration test. It was noted that the denial-of-service attack and missing IPS, while serious issues for a retailer, were not PCI-relevant findings and would not be required in order to obtain a clean report. The Client corrected all High and Medium-severity vulnerabilities within a 90-day window and the Pen Test Company provided documentation of successful remediation to the Client. 6.2 Hosting Provider Penetration Test Case Study Case Introduction PCIData Hosting is a hosting service provider. The only cardholder data environment that exists within PCIData Hosting belongs to its PCI DSS compliant customer, TechMerchant. TechMerchant is operating an e-commerce web environment on the PCIData hosting hardware. TechMerchant is solely responsible for the administration and maintenance of all the software and applications used to support its e-commerce environment. PCIData Hosting is bound by contract with TechMerchant to maintain PCI Compliance. PCIData Hosting is required to maintain PCI Compliance by TechMerchant since PCIData Hosting provides critical security services to TechMerchant for its PCI DSS compliance. In addition, PCIData Hosting has a wish to extend this type of PCI DSS hosting service to more customers in the payment card industry. PCIData Hosting is managing the systems in the cardholder data environment and is responsible for physical security, hardware, network, firewalls, and OS including updates, configuration etc. Applications and databases are not the responsibility of PCIData Hosting. Storing, processing, and transmitting cardholder data are in TechMerchant’s scope and have been described and assessed in its own PCI DSS Assessment. PCIData Hosting has no type of cardholder data transactions in scope, and the only entity hosted from a PCI perspective is TechMerchant, for whom they only provide hardware hosting services and logical system management. Description of Environment The environment at PCIData Hosting consists of five different networks:  ODIN Network Zone: Only VMware Hypervisors used for the TechMerchant CDE servers and environment are hosted in this network segment. This network is not accessible from the THOR network.  THOR Network Zone: This network is the CDE environment where TechMerchant has its virtual servers located; all servers located at this network are in PCI scope. The network is separated into smaller networks: DMZ, secure database zone, and an application zone. These networks are included in the penetration test performed", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Penetration-Testing-Guidance-v1_1 (1)", "chunk_id": 24}}
