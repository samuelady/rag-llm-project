{"text": "penetration tests can be conducted, the organization must receive approval from the third party (i.e., hosting provider, etc.) before the assessment is to take place.  The scope may not include the infrastructure provided by the third party to the entity. The scope may include any systems managed, built, or utilized by the organization.  Unless otherwise noted in the scope, web-management portals provided by the third party for the entity to manage its infrastructure should not be included in the penetration test—these interfaces should be tested and validated as part of the third party’s PCI DSS compliance efforts, and evidence or attestation of validation should be provided to the customer. 4.1.5 Success Criteria The intent of a penetration test is to simulate a real-world attack situation with a goal of identifying how far an attacker may be able to penetrate into the environment. Defining the success criteria for the penetration test allows the entity to set limits on the depth of the penetration test. Without agreeing upon the point at which the penetration test is complete, there is a possibility of the tester exceeding the boundaries and expectations of the target entity. This should be documented in the rules of engagement. Possible success criteria may include:  Direct observation of restricted services or data in the absence of expected access controls  Compromise of an intermediary device used by privileged users to access the CDE  Compromise of the domain used by privileged users  No compromise of the target systems The success criteria will be different for every environment and should be established during initial pre- engagement meeting prior to testing. 4.1.6 Review of Past Threats and Vulnerabilities PCI DSS Requirement 11.3 requires a review and consideration of threats and vulnerabilities encountered by the assessed entity within the past 12 months. This is an historical look at real vulnerabilities experienced or discovered in the entity’s environment since the last assessment. This information may provide insight to the process in place to handle these vulnerabilities. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 16\\nThe penetration tester should be familiar with current vulnerabilities seen by the industry over the past 12 months as well as take a detailed look at recent vulnerabilities experienced by the entity. Depending on the type of test to be performed (i.e., white box, grey box, black box), the following may or may not be considered in such a review:  Vulnerabilities discovered by the entity which have not been remediated within the time period required by PCI DSS (example: quarterly), and/or by the vulnerability remediation requirements documented in the corporate security policy  Existing compensating controls mitigating the noted vulnerabilities  Deployments or upgrades in progress (consider both hardware and software)  If applicable, threats or vulnerabilities that may have led to a data breach  Validation of the remediation of previous years’ penetration test findings  Identification of industry “state of existing vulnerabilities” for purposes of tracking", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Penetration-Testing-Guidance-v1_1", "chunk_id": 12}}
