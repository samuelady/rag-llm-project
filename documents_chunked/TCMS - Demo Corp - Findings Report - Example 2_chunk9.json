[file removed] Demo Corp BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL Page 20 of 38\\nFinding IPT-009: Insufficient Patch Management – Operating Systems (Critical) Description: Demo Corp permitted various deprecated software in their network. This includes: • Windows Server 2003 (end of life on July 14, 2015) • Windows Server 2008 R2 (end of life on January 14, 2020) • Windows XP (end of life on April 8, 2014) • Windows 7 (end of life on January 14, 2020) • Ubuntu 11 (end of life on May 9, 2013) • FreeBSD 11.0 (end of life on October, 2016) End of life systems are susceptible to a multitude of vulnerabilities. TCMS did not attempt any attacks against these servers due to the risk of a denial of service, which is out of scope. Risk: Likelihood: High – An attacker can discover these vulnerabilities with basic tools. Impact: High – If exploited, an attacker could possibly gain full remote code execution on or deny service to a system. System: Identified 139 machines, please see the below file for listing.

Demo Corp BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL Page 21 of 38\\nFinding IPT-010: Insufficient Patching – MS08-067 - ECLIPSEDWING/NETAPI (Critical) Description: Demo Corp permitted an unpatched system on the internal network that is vulnerable to MS08-067. TCM Security confirmed that the vulnerability likely exists but did not attempt the exploit to prevent any denial of service. Risk: Likelihood: High – Considered one of the most exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows as it ships natively with Windows XP. Impact: Very High – If exploited, an attacker gains code execution as the system user. An adversary will require additional techniques to obtain domain administrator access.

TCM Security confirmed that the vulnerability likely exists but did not attempt the exploit to prevent any denial of service. Risk: Likelihood: High – The vulnerability is easily discoverable and exploitable with open-source tools. Impact: Very High – If exploited, an attacker gains code execution as the system user. An adversary will require additional techniques to obtain domain administrator access.
