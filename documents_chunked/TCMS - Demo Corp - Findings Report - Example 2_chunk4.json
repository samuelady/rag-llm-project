{"text": "attempt to exploit any remote code execution (RCE) based vulnerabilities, such as MS17-010 (Finding IPT-012), as the domain controller had already been compromised and the teams did not want to risk any denial of service through failed attacks. We recommend that the Demo Corp team review the patching recommendations made in the Technical Findings section of the report along with reviewing the provided Nessus scans for a full overview of items to be patched. We also recommend that Demo Corp improve their patch management policies and procedures to help prevent potential attacks within their network. Demo Corp BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL Page 9 of 38\\nOn a positive note, our testing team triggered several alerts during the engagement. The Demo Corp Security Operations team discovered our vulnerability scanning and was alerted when we attempted to use noisy attacks on a compromised machine. While not all attacks were discovered during testing, these alerts are a positive start. Additional guidance on alerting and detection has been provided for findings, when necessary, in the Technical Findings section. Overall, the Demo Corp network performed as expected for a first-time penetration test. We recommend that the Demo Corp team thoroughly review the recommendations made in this report, patch the findings, and re-test annually to improve their overall internal security posture. Key Strengths and Weaknesses The following identifies the key strengths identified during the assessment: 1. Observed some scanning of common enumeration tools (Nessus) 2. Mimikatz detected on some machines 3. Service accounts were not running as domain administrators 4. Demo Corp local administrator account password was unique to each device The following identifies the key weaknesses identified during the assessment: 1. Password policy found to be insufficient 2. Critically out-of-date operating systems and weak patching exist within the network 3. Passwords were observed in cleartext due to WDigest 4. LLMNR is enabled within the network 5. SMB signing is disabled on all non-server devices in the work 6. IPv6 is improperly managed within the network 7. User accounts can be impersonated through token delegation 8. Local admin accounts had password re-use and were overly permissive 9. Default credentials were discovered on critical infrastructure, such as iDRACs 10. Unauthenticated share access was permitted 11. User accounts were found to be running as service accounts 12. Service accounts utilized weak passwords 13. Domain administrator utilized weak passwords Demo Corp BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL Page 10 of 38\\nVulnerability Summary & Report Card The following tables illustrate the vulnerabilities found by impact and recommended remediations: Internal Penetration Test Findings 13 5 6 0 1 Critical High Moderate Low Informational Finding Severity Recommendation Internal Penetration Test IPT-001: Insufficient LLMNR Critical Disable multicast name resolution via Configuration GPO.
