The people, processes, systems, and software all have some type of relationship. This interconnectedness requires interactions. Some interactions are passive and some are not. Some interactions are symbiotic while others are parasitic. Some interactions are controlled by one side of the relationship while others are controlled by both. Then some controls are flawed or superfluous, which is harmful to at least one side of the relationship, if not both. Other controls balance perfectly with the interactions. Whatever becomes of the interconnectedness, however the interactions occur, however they are controlled, they are the operations that make survival possible. When we test operations we get the big picture of our relationships. We get to see the interconnectedness of the operations in fine detail. We get to map out how we, our businesses, and our operations will survive and even thrive. Unfortunately, how we interact is just based on a collection of biases we accumulate during life, which are subjected to the emotional or bio-chemical state we are under when we have them. These are our shortcuts. Due to the incredible number of decisions we must make through-out all of our interactions we use a mental cheat-sheet to compare similar interactions rather than calculate each situation independently. We are, after all, only human. Most often though our opinions are limited and restricted to a small scope we know as “our little world”. We apply them everywhere because they make life easier. But when we take them with us and try to adhere them to larger, different, more complicated series and types of interactions, we will likely make mistakes.
