(b) Examine e-mail headers, bounced mails, read receipts, mail failures, and malware rejections to determine outgoing gateway systems and internal addressing. (c) Examine target web-based application source code and scripts to determine the existence of additional targets in the network. (d) Examine service and application emanations. Manipulate and replay captured traffic to invoke new requests or responses, gain depth, or expose additional information. For example, SQL, Citrix, HTTP, SAP, DNS, ARP, etc. (e) Search web logs and intrusion logs for system trails from the target network. (f) Verify all responses from UDP packet requests to ports 0-65535. (g) Verify responses to UDP packet requests FROM SOURCE ports 0, 53, 139, and 161 to 0, 53, 69, 131, and 161. (h) Verify responses to UDP packet requests with BAD CHECKSUMS to all discovered ports and for 0, 53, 69, 131, and 161. (i) Verify service request responses to common and contemporary UDP remote access malware ports. (j) Verify responses from TCP SYN packet requests to ports 0-65535. (k) Verify responses from TCP service requests to ports 0, 21, 22, 23, 25, 53, 80, and 443. (l) Verify responses from a TCP ACK with a SOURCE port of 80 to ports 3100-3150, 10001-10050, 33500-33550, and 50 random ports above 35000. (m)Verify responses from TCP SYN fragments to ports 0, 21, 22, 23, 25, 53, 80, and 443. (n) Verify responses from all combinations of TCP flags to ports 0, 21, 22, 23, 25, 53, 80, and 443. (o) Verify the use of all targets with HTTP or HTTPS based VPNs, proxies, and URL redirectors to redirect requests for targets within the scope. (p) Verify the use of all targets with sequential IPIDs to enumerate systems within the network. (q) Map and verify for consistency visible systems and responding ports by TTLs. 11.4.3 Identification Identify targetsâ€™ TTL response, system uptime, services, applications, application faults, and correlate this with the responses from system and service fingerprinting tools.

(b) Request known, common VPN services including those which utilize IPSEC and IKE for connections from all addresses. (c) Manipulate network service and routing to access past restrictions within the scope. (d) Request known, common Trojan services which utilize UDP for connections from all addresses.
