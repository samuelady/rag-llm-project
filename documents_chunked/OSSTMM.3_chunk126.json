Compliance is compulsory; however, as with any other threat, a risk assessment must be made whether or not to invest in any type of compliance. Often, compliance is not as black and white as it appears to be. The OSSTMM recognizes three types of compliance: 1. Legislative. Compliance with legislation is in accordance to the region where the legislation can be enforced. The strength and commitment to the legislation comes from previously successful legal arguments and appropriately set and just enforcement measures. Failure to comply with legislation may lead to criminal charges. Examples are Sarbanes-Oxley, HIPAA, and the various Data Protection and Privacy legislation. 2. Contractual. Compliance to contractual requirements are in accordance to the industry or within the group that requires the contract and may take action to enforce compliance. Failure to comply with contractual requirements often leads to dismissal from the group, a loss of privileges, loss of reputation, civil charges, and in some cases where legislation exists to support the regulatory body, criminal charges. An example is the payment card industry data security standard (PCI DSS) promoted and required by VISA and MasterCard. 3. Standards based. Compliance to standards is in accordance with the business or organization where the compliance to standards is enforced as policy. Failure to comply with standards often leads to dismissal from the organization, a loss of privileges, a loss of reputation or brand trust, civil charges, and in some cases where legislation exists to support the policy makers, criminal charges. Examples are the OSSTMM, ISO 27001/5, and ITIL. The OSSTMM is developed with concern for major legislation, contractual requirements, and standards conformance. As not all compliance objectives are created equally, the main focus of the OSSTMM is security. Compliance measures that require specific products or services, commercial or otherwise, often through specially lobbied efforts, may have good intentions; however, may actually be a waste of resources or a lesser version of security than is desired. That a compliance objective can require a specific product at all should be illegal itself. As legislation and regulation may be audited either under the letter of the law or the spirit of the law, depending upon the auditing body, proving", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 126}}
