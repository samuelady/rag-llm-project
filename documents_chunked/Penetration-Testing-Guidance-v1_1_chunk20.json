The intent is to provide a tool that could be used by merchants, service providers, and assessors to quickly determine the depth of testing and quality of the reporting based upon the contractual agreement between the organization and the tester. It should be noted that this checklist is not intended to take the place of thorough report inspection, interpretation of the findings, and taking appropriate action. Table 1 details the questions, a place to record whether the item is included in the report and the page number where it is found. It is not the intent to generate any type of “score” from the results, as its intent is to provide a communication tool that may be used between the entity and the tester after a report has been written and the results evaluated. It should be noted that these items represent a suggested minimum set of items to look for in the report; additional content may be present.
