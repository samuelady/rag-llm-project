{"text": "were not necessarily exploitable but which are deemed to pose a potential risk to the environment. It is recommended that the report contain any findings that impact the security posture of the assessed entity even in cases where exploitation did not occur. Some examples of identified vulnerabilities that were not exploited for valid reasons and should be included in the report may be:  Firewall misconfigurations that permit unauthorized traffic between secure and insecure zones  Detection of credentials obtained through manipulation of a web-application error message that was not flagged during an ASV scan due to a low CVSS base score 5.1.1 Assigning a Severity Score In order to prioritize remediation of the penetration test findings, it is a common practice during the reporting phase for a severity or risk ranking to be assigned for each detected security issue. The report should clearly document how the severity/risk ranking is derived. In most cases, severity/risk ranking may be applied as a result of evaluating an industry-standard score (e.g., NVD, CVSS) against a threshold or value that indicates risk (i.e., high, medium, and low). However, it should be noted that it is possible for a vulnerability to exist that is inherent to a particular environment; therefore, a standardized score is not available. When custom scoring is part of the risk-ranking process, the report should reflect a traceable set of reasoning for the modification of industry-standard scores or, where applicable, for the creation of a score for a vulnerability that does not have an industry-standard score defined. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 21\\n5.1.2 Industry Standard References Some well-known, industry-standard references include:  National Vulnerability Database (NVD)  Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE)  Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)  Bugtraq ID (BID)  Open Source Vulnerability Database (OSVDB) The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an example of an open framework that may be referenced for assigning a baseline risk rating. The CVSS is the required scoring system for Approved Scanning Vendors (ASVs) to use for ranking vulnerabilities detected during PCI vulnerability scans. Using this system, a standardized vulnerability score can be adjusted through the evaluation of the traits of vulnerability within the context of a specific environment. 5.2 Reporting Guidelines Comprehensive and consistent reporting is a critical phase of a penetration test. This section provides guidelines on common contents of an industry standard penetration test. It should be noted that these are only suggested outlines and do not define specific reporting requirements for PCI DSS penetration tests. Testers may have different sections, alternative titles, and/or report format, etc.; this outline represents data gathered from a number of penetration testing providers and the desires of customers. 5.2.1 Penetration Test Report Outline  Executive Summary Brief high-level summary of the penetration test scope and major findings o  Statement of Scope A detailed definition of the scope of the network and systems tested as part of o the", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Security Standards Council - Penetration-Testing-Guidance-v1_1", "chunk_id": 17}}
