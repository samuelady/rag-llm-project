This is a Special Publication 800-30, which shows one method of risk analysis and calculation. Recommendation \"Presenting a piece of vulnerability in your findings without documenting how the vulnerability could be managed is only half of your security assessment job. The other half is presenting potential solutions, mitigations, or other suggestions for reducing or eliminating the vulnerability.\" (Smith et al., 2004). Based on the risk rating and the target asset, the penetration tester should provide an acceptable recommendation with alternatives. For example, for weak authentication protocols being used to validate accounts for accessing a customer database through the ASP Web application, pen tester may provide more than option for mitigating the risk such as: 1-Implement Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) by providing certificate to all users of the database and require certificate-based authentication on the front-end )*+,%\"&(!.$*&/01(2$*&/0342*0.-5%2( ( ( @ 2021 SANS Institute Author Retains Full Rights\\n! !
