{"text": "steps, the tester should perform a retest to validate the newly implemented controls mitigate the original risk. Remediation efforts extending for a long period after the initial test may require a new testing engagement to be performed to ensure accurate results of the most current environment are reported. This determination may be made after a risk analysis of how much change has occurred since the original testing was completed. In specific conditions, the flagged security issue may represent a fundamental flaw in an environment or application. The scope of a retest should consider whether any changes occurring as a result of remediation identified from the test are classified as significant. All changes should be retested; however, whether a complete system retest is necessary will be determined by the risk assessment of those changes. 4.3.3 Cleaning up the Environment It is important for the tester to document and disclose to the organization any alterations made to the environment (as permitted in the Rules of Engagement) during the test, including but not limited to:  Accounts that were created as a part of the assessment either by the entity or the tester: the organization should then remove these accounts.  Tools installed by the tester on the organization’s systems: these tools should be removed at the end of the testing. Removal of accounts and test tools will ensure the accounts or remnant tools could not be exploited or used against the organization. 4.4 Additional Resources There are multiple industry-accepted methodologies that may provide additional guidance on penetration testing activities, including but not limited to:  Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (“OSSTMM”)  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Special Publication 800-115  OWASP Testing Guide  Penetration Testing Execution Standard  Penetration Testing Framework The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

Merely reporting lists of vulnerabilities is not helpful in this endeavor and does not meet the intent of the penetration test. The report should be structured in a way to clearly communicate what was tested, how it was tested, and the results of the testing. This section provides guidance on documenting identified and/or exploited vulnerabilities, creating reporting templates, and evaluating a penetration test report. 5.1 Identified Vulnerability Reporting Penetration test reports should include a discussion of the steps, vectors, and exploited vulnerabilities that lead to penetration during testing for which remediation and retesting are required. However, it is possible for the tester to identify vulnerabilities that were not necessarily exploitable but which are deemed to pose a potential risk to the environment. It is recommended that the report contain any findings that impact the security posture of the assessed entity even in cases where exploitation did not occur.
