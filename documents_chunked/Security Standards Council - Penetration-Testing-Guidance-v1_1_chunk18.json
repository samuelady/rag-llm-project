For example, if o the environment did not have any active services, explain what testing was performed to verify restricted access. Document any issues encountered during testing (e.g., interference was encountered o as a result of active protection systems blocking traffic).  Segmentation Test Results Summarize the testing performed to validate segmentation controls, if used to reduce o the scope of PCI DSS.  Findings Whether/how the CDE may be exploited using each vulnerability. o Risk ranking/severity of each vulnerability o Targets affected o References (if available) o CVE, CWE, BID, OSBDB, etc. - Vendor and/or researcher - Description of finding o  Tools Used  Cleaning up the Environment Post-Penetration Test After testing there may be tasks the tester or customer needs to perform to restore the target environment (i.e., update/removal of test accounts or database entries added or modified during testing, uninstall of test tools or other artifacts, restoring active protection-system settings, and/or other activities the tester may not have permissions to perform, etc.). Provide directions on how cleanup should be performed and how to verify security o controls have been restored. 5.2.2 Retesting Considerations and Report Outline If the noted findings will require remediation and retesting before an assessor can determine the entity has met PCI DSS Requirement 11.3, a follow-up test report may be provided. All remediation efforts should be completed and retested within a reasonable period of time after the original penetration test report was provided. It is expected that the remediation test report will cover all identified/exploitable vulnerabilities that require remediation. Those identified vulnerabilities is may be medium or high for external penetration tests and those defined by the organization as medium or high for internal tests. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.
