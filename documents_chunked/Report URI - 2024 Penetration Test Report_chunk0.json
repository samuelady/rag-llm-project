Report URI are the best real-time monitoring platform for cutting edge web standards. Their experience, focus, and exposure allow them to take the hassle out of collecting, processing, and understanding reports, giving customers just the information they need. Report URI have indicated the need for a repeat security test of their ‘Report URI’ application in order to identify vulnerabilities to attacks that could be launched across a computer network, and to provide security assurances regarding their systems. Such a test will allow Report URI to undertake remediation efforts and increase their overall security posture. 2.1 Scope & Duration This assessment included the following phase of work: • Phase 1 – Web application assessment of Report URI application The duration included 5 days effort (including reporting). Work commenced on 11/11/2024 and concluded on 19/11/2024. 2.2 Scenarios Included • Black-Box assessment – testing the web application while unauthenticated without additional information. This simulates a real-world threat posed to all Internet facing services. • Rogue-User Scenario – using credentials provided to simulate the risk as various levels of user account. This simulates the risk of a user either by choice or by being compromised attacking the system. • White-box assessment – using the source code provided. All the tests were performed against the production environment. 2.3 Target(s) • https://report-uri.com Confidential 4 3756 – Web App Test\\nConfidential 5 3756 - App Test <CustomerNameLong> 3 Executive Summary Overall, the Report URI application performed well during the assessment.
