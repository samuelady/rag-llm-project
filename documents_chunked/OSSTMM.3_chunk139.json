This provides an organization with an incredible amount of intelligence over their own operations for comparisons with other organizations, or even just trending self assessments. It is the kind of information that decisions require, and that which foster significant operational improvements. Second, it changes the frequency of security tests required because, instead of defenses being based on reacting to attacks and vulnerabilities, they are part of change control instead. Therefore when new operations are initiated, the environment will be re-assessed for new or different points of interaction. The need to test for new flaws is no longer necessary nor is the need to test for compatibility of security updates after fixing those flaws. Security updates, if desired, will instead become part of the change control process and can be tested on schedule. This will drastically reduce the time spent putting out fires so that new focus can be put on improving operations and building better infrastructure. Third, it changes the often secretive and socially demanding way we use trust within organizations. It allows the performance and history of each individual to speak for itself. This adds accountability to each role and removes prejudices that can strangle an organization, either operationally or legally. Not to mention it is the most fair means of assuring each person has the responsibility over their own successes and failures. The changes required by the typical organization to achieve these benefits are actually small. The changes required by the security industry to meet the new needs of the implementers of the Möbius Defense will be huge. And change will bring new opportunities.
