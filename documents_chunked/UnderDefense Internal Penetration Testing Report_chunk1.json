The recommendations provided in this report are structured to facilitate remediation of the identified security risks. This document serves as a formal letter of attestation for the recent [CLIENT_NAME] “Gray Box” internal network penetration testing. Evaluation ratings compare information gathered during the engagement to “best in class” criteria for security standards. We believe that the statements made in this document provide an accurate assessment of the [CLIENT_NAME]’s current security. We highly recommend reviewing the Summary section of business risks and High-Level Recommendations for a better understanding of risks and discovered security issues. Scope of assessment Security Level Grade Internal Network Perimeter F Unacceptable Wireless Network Perimeter A Excellent Grade Security Criteria Description The security exceeds “Industry Best Practice” standards. The overall AA Excellent posture was found to be excellent with only a few low-risk findings identified. The security meets accepted standards for “Industry Best Practice.” B Good The overall posture was found to be strong with only a handful of medium- and low-risk shortcomings identified. Current solutions protect some areas of the enterprise from security B Fair issues. Moderate changes are required to elevate the discussed areas to “Industry Best Practice” standards Significant security deficiencies exist. Immediate attention should be D Poor given to the discussed issues to address exposures identified. Major changes are required to elevate to “Industry Best Practice” standards. Serious security deficiencies exist. Shortcomings were identified F Unacceptable throughout most or even all of the security controls examined. Improving security will require a major allocation of resources. Please be informed that this is an incomplete version of the UnderDefense Internal Penetration Testing Report.
