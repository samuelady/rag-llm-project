These are things that an experienced testing group already does. Don’t confuse the formality in the dissection of the process with the formality of the reporting. You don’t have to show every step being done but you should understand how you got from A to C. It is like giving people driving directions. You tell them the steps on where they turn and relative proximity to things that they will see to know they are going the right way but you don’t tell them every street they drive down and every traffic signal they must obey to get to the end. Well, the 4PP is the specific directions and the means and reporting are actually the relativistic ones. Interactions within the 4 Point Process 1. Induction: (Z) establishing principle truths about the target from environmental laws and facts. The Analyst determines factual principles regarding the target from the environment where the target resides. As the target will be influenced by its environment, its behavior will be determinable within this influence. Where the target is not influenced by its environment, there exists an anomaly to be understood. 2. Inquest: (C) investigating target emanations. The Analyst investigates the emanations from the target and any tracks or indicators of those emanations. A system or process will generally leave a signature of its existence through interactions with its environment. 3. Interaction: (A/B) like echo tests, standard and non-standard interactions with the target to trigger responses. The Analyst will inquire or agitate the target to trigger responses for analysis. 4. Intervention: (X/Y/Z) changing resource interactions with the target or between targets. The Analyst will intervene with the resources the target requires from its environment or from its interactions with other targets to understand the extremes under which it can continue operating adequately.

It is designed as a flowchart; however, unlike the standard flowchart, the flow, represented by the arrows, may go backward as well as forward. In this way, it is more integrated and while the beginning and the end are clear, the audit has greater flexibility. The Analyst creates a unique path through the methodology based on the target, the type of test, the time allotted for the audit, and the resources applied to the test. For an orchestra, the composer writes the sheet music to designate the order and duration of notes, but only the conductor can control the execution of the performance. This methodology is like the sheet music, designating the necessary tests, but the Analyst controls the order, the duration, as well as the execution.
