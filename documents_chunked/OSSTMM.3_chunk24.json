{"text": "an OSSTMM test should provide documentation that provides an understandable, verifiable level of quality. The use of the OSSTMM, however, is designed to allow the Analyst to view and understand security and safety. Therefore, with the use of this methodology, any compliance is, at least, the production of evidence of governance within the business process of security.

Testing is a complicated affair and with anything complicated, you approach it in small, comprehensible pieces to be sure you don’t make mistakes. Conventional wisdom says complexity is an enemy of security. However, it is only at odds with human nature. Anything which is made more complex is not inherently insecure. Consider a computer managing complex tasks. The problem as we know it is not that the computer will make mistakes, confuse the tasks, or forget to complete some. As more tasks are added to the computer, it gets slower and slower, taking more time to complete all the tasks. People, however, do make mistakes, forget tasks, and purposely abandon tasks which are either not important or required at the moment. So when testing security, what you need to do is properly manage any complexity. This is done by properly defining the security test. 2.1 Defining a Security Test These 7 steps will take you to the start of a properly defined security test. 1. Define what you want to protect. These are the assets. The protection mechanisms for these assets are the Controls you will test to identify Limitations. 2. Identify the area around the assets which includes the protection mechanisms and the processes or services built around the assets. This is where interaction with assets will take place. This is your engagement zone. 3. Define everything outside the engagement zone that you need to keep your assets operational. This may include things you may not be able to directly influence like electricity, food, water, air, stable ground, information, legislation, regulations and things you may be able to work with like dryness, warmth, coolness, clarity, contractors, colleagues, branding, partnerships, and so on. Also count that which keeps the infrastructure operational like processes, protocols, and continued resources. This is your test scope. 4. Define how your scope interacts within itself and with the outside. Logically compartmentalize the assets within the scope through the direction of interactions such as inside to outside, outside to inside, inside to inside, department A to department B, etc. These are your vectors. Each vector should ideally be a separate test to keep each compartmentalized test duration short before too much change can occur within the environment. 5. Identify what equipment will be needed for each test. Inside each vector, interactions may occur on various levels. These levels may be classified in", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 24}}
