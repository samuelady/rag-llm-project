{"text": "were covered by the tests. The application was tested as a part of the TechMerchant’s annual PCI penetration test and is not considered in scope for PCIData Hosting’s PCI penetration test, therefore the focus is network- layer testing. The following documentation was reviewed before the assessment:  A network diagram  Results from quarterly external and internal vulnerability scans  Results from the last penetration test  The scope of the TechMerchant’s last penetration test  Security policies  Review of PCIData Hosting’s risk analysis. The following tests were performed during the assessment:  Internal penetration tests from LOKE (guest network), HEJMDAL (management network) and from the office network located in BALDER (Client).  Social engineering against PCIData Hosting administrators of ODIN (VMware) and THOR (CDE servers) in form of phishing e-mails  Physical security assessment as a part of the penetration test.  External testing of PCIData Hosting of their external IP-addresses. All servers, databases, employees with access to the CDE, etc. are considered in scope for the penetration test. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 32\\nPre-Test Preparations A user account was created for the penetration tester following the regular procedures for granting access to new employees. Access credentials for the guest network were also granted to the tester. Engagement Phase (Discovery and Attack/Execution) Discovery was performed on the LOKE (guest), HEJMDAL (management) and BALDER (office) networks to identify targets (servers, network components, workstations, etc.) on the networks, and analyzing techniques were used to get an understanding of the environment. The objectives of this phase were to identify systems, ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities. This phase was performed both manually and via automated tools including network discovery and port and service detection. When enough data was collected in the discovery phase, the penetration tester tried to gain access to the targets discovered. When access was gained to targets the tester tried to escalate privileges in order to gain complete control of the target. The access obtained was then used to gain more information about the environment, and a new discovery phase was started. The primary goal for the discovery and attack/execution was gaining access to the CDE, including the VMware hosts. The techniques used included password cracking, vulnerability scanning, social engineering, and network-layer testing. The above was completed for the following different perspectives during the assessment:  External attacker without knowledge of the environment  Internal attacker (guest, contractor, etc.)  Internal attacker (employee without access to the CDE) The following tests were performed during the assessment:  External attacker without knowledge of the environment External VPN connection was tested. o Phishing e-mails were sent to carefully selected victims who all are working with administrating o the CDE environment. Attempts to gain access to the data center without having notified the data center up front. o Vulnerabilities related to the VPN connection were not found during the external test. Phishing e- mails were sent but the exploits were caught by", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Security Standards Council - Penetration-Testing-Guidance-v1_1", "chunk_id": 26}}
