{"text": "interacting with the target, and the last step is the review of the records of the audit trail. For the Analyst, this is simply: you know what you need to do, you do it, and then you check what you have done. This methodology separates what needs to be done into this hierarchical format: 1. CHANNEL 2. MODULE 3. TASK The work is described in the module description for each particular channel audit. Some audits apply to technologies which may straddle the border between two or more channels. For example, commonly found wireless LANs must be tested under both the Data Networks channel and the Wireless channel. This is why a properly defined testing plan is so important. Channel hybridization is a constant and should not be overlooked. The OSSTMM is fully capable of a “sidewalk to kernel” security review and therefore is completely capable of applying an analysis to a target whether its channels are clearly distinct and separate or comprised of multiple channels. Therefore, for all targets, the Analyst should anticipate the need to define an audit to include multiple channels. Sometimes only under investigation will it become evident whether the scope contains any targets under a particular channel or if the Analyst will miss targets only available under other channels. This methodology applies to all five channels. It has 17 modules and all the same properties apply to all five channels. While the methodology itself may be the same, each channel differs in tasks. Each module has an input and an output. The input is the information used in performing each task. The output is the result of completed tasks. This output may or may not be intelligence (analyzed data) to serve as an input for another module and this output may further serve as the input for more than one module or section. Therefore, failure to complete certain modules or tasks may limit the successful completion of other modules or tasks. This would limit the thoroughness of the audit far more than just an accounting for the missing tasks would reveal. Some tasks yield no output, meaning that modules will exist for which there is no input. Modules which have no input can be ignored during testing but must be later documented with an explanation for not having been performed. Also, tasks with no output do not necessarily indicate an inferior test; rather, they may indicate superior security. In detail, tasks that have no resulting output can mean any of five things: 1. The channel was obstructed in some way during the performance of the tasks. 2. The tasks were not properly performed. 3. The tasks were not applicable. 4. The task result data has been improperly analyzed. 5. The task reveals superior security. It is important that impartiality and open-mindedness exist in performing the tasks of each module. The primary tenet for auditing states, in similar regard to a conformational bias: “When one searches for something, one expects to find it, which may lead you", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 77}}
