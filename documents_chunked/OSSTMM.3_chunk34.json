{"text": "composer writes the sheet music to designate the order and duration of notes, but only the conductor can control the execution of the performance. This methodology is like the sheet music, designating the necessary tests, but the Analyst controls the order, the duration, as well as the execution. The main reason for requiring this level of flexibility in the OSSTMM is because no methodology can accurately presume the justifications for the operations of channel gateways in a target and their adequate level of security. More directly, this methodology cannot presume a best practice for conducting all audits, as best practice is based on a specific configuration of operations. Best practice is only best for some; generally the originator of the practice. Operations dictate how services should be offered, and those services dictate the requirements for operational security. Therefore, a methodology that is invoked differently for each audit and by each Analyst can still have the same end result if the Analyst completes the methodology. For this reason one of the foundations of the OSSTMM is to record precisely what was not tested. By comparing what was tested and the depth of the testing with other tests, it is possible to measure operational security (OpSec) based on the test results. Applying this methodology will therefore meet the Analyst’s goal to answer the following three questions which make up the Trifecta, the answer to OpSec needs. 1. How do current operations work? The derived metrics can be applied to determine the problem areas within the scope and which problems must be addressed. The metrics in this methodology are designed to map the problems in different ways so as to show if the problem is a general one or more specific, like an overlook or a mistake. 2. How do they work differently from how management thinks they work? Access to policies or a trust (or even a risk) assessment will map back to the different categories of the metrics. The categories provide the current state values where a comparison can be made with both an optimum state according to the policies and one according to assessed threats. 3. How do they need to work? Where the metrics show no gap between policy or trust (or risk) assessment’s optimum values yet the security test shows that there is indeed a protection problem regardless of controls as implemented in policy, it is possible to clearly denote a problem. Often, without even mapping to policy, a discrepancy between the implemented controls and the loss of protection is simply evident.

The steps in this application can be summarized as follows: 1. Passively collect data of normal operations to comprehend the target. 2. Actively test operations by agitating operations beyond the normal baseline. 3. Analyze data received directly from the operations tested. 4.
