{"text": "attempt to access to the Domain Controllers to help facilitate network traversal and further compromise of security controls and monitoring systems. With Domain access, complete infrastructure compromise is likely; with this level of access an attacker presents numerous serious security risks to critical and confidential information systems. Internet facing assets at CLIENT have little to no interactivity and so pose less of a threat to intrusion through these systems. However, the systems are vulnerable to Man-in-the-middle (MITM) type attacks which could be utilized by an attacker to gain access to private communications and potentially steal passwords to gain further access into the network. 5.2 Implications Based on the above testing activities, the average risk level across the board is EXTREME Complete system compromise is trivially achieved on critical security and file servers, systems that contain myriad important and confidential files which, if breached, can put CLIENT at great risk to large fines and significant business impact. Disable SMB on any system that does not require it for business functionality. Even with recent patches, Windows systems using SMB remain vulnerable to ETERNALBLUE type exploits so long as the service is running. System hardening needs to be implemented immediately to shrink the risk landscape of the infrastructure. Controls and configurations should be centrally managed; management and security systems such as the McAfee server should be secured using sales@purplesec.us 24\\nPEN TEST REPORT: EXAMPLE INSTITUTE JANUARY28,2019 controls designed around Least Privilege and Critical Infrastructure NIST recommendations. Compromise of these systems pose a critical threat. Implement system patching management cycle to ensure that all systems are regularly receiving important security updates from vendors. Revoke or replace PFX files in user profiles as a precaution Data compliance and end user social engineering training should be implemented to promote safer practices. HIPAA data should be contained to ONLY systems that require access to the data; it is encouraged that these systems employ good data at rest encryption and least privilege access controls to prevent unauthorized access. Best practice is to centrally store these types of files on a managed, hardened network location, users should access the files only via network connectors in their in profiles with configured security permissions.
