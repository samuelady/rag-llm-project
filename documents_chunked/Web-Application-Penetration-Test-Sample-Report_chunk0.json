The intent of an application assessment is to dynamically identify and assess the impact of potential security vulnerabilities within the application. During this assessment, both manual and automated testing tools and techniques were employed to discover and exploit possible vulnerabilities. All testing activities were conducted against the {URL} development environment to limit the impact of any service disruptions. Assessment of the {URL} application began on {Begin.Date} and concluded on {End.Date}. Testing was conducted from both an unauthenticated and authenticated context. Unauthenticated testing examines the exterior security posture of an application and looks for vulnerabilities that do not require authentication to exploit, while authenticated tests focus on discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities on portions of the internal application that are only accessible after successful authentication. Assessors were provided both a regular user and an administrative user account to assess the internal security controls of the application. PurpleSec assessors were able to identify and exploit instances of the following vulnerabilities: Vulnerability Severity Cross-Site Scripting (Stored) High Authorization Restriction Bypass High Open-Redirect High Low Severity 1 Low Low Severity 2 Low The Stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability had four separate instances. Each of these instances could be leveraged by an attacker to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim, conduct phishing attacks, or force the download of malicious software.\\nThe Authorization Restriction Bypass vulnerability had two separate instances; both would allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information on application users and their data. This unauthorized information disclosure could be leveraged to aid other attacks and cause reputational harm. The last high-severity finding discovered was an Open-Redirect vulnerability. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to steal session cookies, which in turn would allow an attacker to perform actions within the application as the victim user. Finally, two low-severity findings were also identified during testing. While these vulnerabilities pose no immediate threat to the application or its users, remediating them would further strengthen the application's overall security posture. A detailed explanation of the above vulnerabilities can be found in Appendix A â€“ Findings.\\nAttack Narrative Stored Cross-Site Scripting Severity: High Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a client-side code injection attack. It occurs when data enters from an untrusted source and is included in dynamic content without being validated for malicious content by the application.
