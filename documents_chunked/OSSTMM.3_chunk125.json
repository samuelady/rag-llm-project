(b) Enumerate the use of default accounts on targets. (c) Test access to authenticated access points through the most appropriate and available cracking techniques. Password cracking via dictionary or brute-force may be limited by the time frame of the audit and therefore not a valid test of the protection from that authentication schema however any successful discoveries do attest to its weakness. 11.15.3 Escalation (a) Collect information on persons with high privileges. Look for trusted roles or positions, access gateways for trusted persons, and any required physical access media such as tokens or smart cards. (b) Verify the boundaries of privileges on the target or across multiple targets and if the means exists to escalate those privileges.

Denial of Service (DoS) is a situation where a circumstance, either intentionally or accidentally, prevents the system from functioning as intended. In certain cases, the system may be functioning exactly as designed however it was never intended to handle the load, scope, or parameters being imposed upon it. Survivability tests must be closely monitored as the intent is to cause failure and this may be unacceptable to the targetâ€™s owner. 11.16.1Resilience (a) Verify single points of failure (choke points) in the infrastructure where change or failure can cause a service outage. (b) Verify the impact to target access which a system or service failure will cause. (c) Verify the privileges available from the failure-induced access. (d) Verify the operational functionality of controls to prevent access or permissions above lowest possible privileges upon failure. 11.16.2Continuity (a) Enumerate and test for inadequacies from all targets with regard to access delays and service response times through back-up systems or the switch to alternate channels. (b) Verify intruder lock-out schemes cannot be used against valid users. 11.16.3Safety Map and document the process of gatekeepers shutting down target systems due to evacuation or safety concerns as a gap analysis with regulation and security policy. 11.17 Alert and Log Review A gap analysis between activities performed with the test and the true depth of those activities as recorded or from third-party perceptions both human and mechanical. 11.17.1 Alarm Verify and enumerate the use of a localized or scope-wide warning system, log, or message for each access gateway over each channel where a suspect situation is noted by personnel upon suspicion of circumvention attempts, social engineering, or fraudulent activity. 11.17.2 Storage and Retrieval (a) Document and verify unprivileged access to alarm, log, and notification storage locations and property. (b) Verify the quality and the length of time", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 125}}
