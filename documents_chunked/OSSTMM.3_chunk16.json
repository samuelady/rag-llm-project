{"text": "from identifying marks to their DNA and only their documentation changes. Therefore, a security process can attempt to identify someone by verifying their identity but nothing in this case is granted or provided. There is no true “granting” of identity just as there can be no true “theft” of identity. Furthermore, identity is a collection of thoughts, emotions, experiences, relationships, and intentions, as well as physical shape or marks. You are who you are because you exist not because someone granted that to you. A perfect duplicate or clone of you is still not you because from origin your experiences will differ. While this may sound more like philosophy than security, it is very important that Analysts understand this. Identification processes only verify against a former identification process. If that process has been corrupted or can be circumvented, then the entire security foundation that requires proper identification is flawed. Authorization, like Identification, is another operations control which cannot be transferred. It is the control to grant permissions. An employee authorized to enter a room may hold the door open for another person to enter. This does not authorize the new person. Authorization did not get transferred. This new person is trespassing in a restricted area and the employee who held open the door actually was part of a limitation in the Authentication process to grant Access. Another property of Authorization is that it requires identification to work. Without identification, authorization is a blanket “permit all” without even knowing what all is. However in operations this is itself a paradox because to authorize all without scrutiny means that there is no authorization. Therefore to not authorize you do not use authorization. The Authentication control combines both identification and authorization to map Access. The process is simply knowing who (or what) it is and what, where, when, and how they can access before they are granted access. Because authentication is a control for interactivity, it is one of the five Class A controls, also known as the “Interactive Controls”.

These controls directly influence visibility, access, or trust interactions. The Class A categories are Authentication, Indemnification, Subjugation, Continuity, and Resilience. 1. Authentication is a control through the challenge of credentials based on identification and authorization. 2. Indemnification is a control through a contract between the asset owner and the interacting party. This contract may be in the form of a visible warning as a precursor to legal action if posted rules are not followed, specific, public legislative protection, or with a third-party assurance provider in case of damages like an insurance company. 3. Resilience is a control over all interactions to maintain the protection of assets in the event of corruption or failure. 4. Subjugation is a control assuring that interactions occur only according to defined processes. The asset owner defines how the interaction occurs which removes the freedom", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 16}}
