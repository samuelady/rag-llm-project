{"text": "lines testing (f) Voice over IP testing (g) X.25 packet switched network testing 10.2 Logistics Preparation of the channel test environment needed to prevent false positives and false negatives which lead to inaccurate test results. 10.2.1 Framework (a) Verify the scope and the owner(s) of the targets outlined for the audit, along with the carrier(s) and other third parties managing the telecommunication lines and infrastructure for the targets. (b) Determine the property location and the owner of the property housing the targets. (c) Search for other targets from the same owner. (d) Find and verify the paths of telecommunication services which interact outside of target for the paths they follow into and out of the scope. (e) Determine the physical location of the targets. (f) Test which protocols are used within the scope (example: PSTN, ISDN, GSM, UMTS, SIP, H.323, RTP, XOT, DECNET, IPX, etc.). (g) Verify and document the special limitations imposed by the contract with client. 10.2.2 Network Quality (a) Measure the maximum and minimum connection speeds supported by targets. (b) Determine and verify the appropriate connection speed, parity, RING time, and other specific configuration parameters to be used for scanning and testing. (c) Verify and document particular limitations imposed by the scope (example: X.25 network congestion, XOT strict routes, access filters based on CLID).

(b) Determine and document the time settings (timezone, DST, etc.) for the targets. (c) Assure the Analyst’s time clock is in sync with the time of the targets. Certain equipment like fragile artifacts may have time settings that do not represent a valid time; if the Analyst’s time clock is put in sync with these it may have an impact on the result of the test. (d) Determine the additional financial costs involved in performing thorough tests from a remote location (example: scanning for modems/FAX, testing Remote Access Services not on toll-free numbers, placing X.25 calls without reverse charge). 10.3 Active Detection Verification Determination of active controls to detect intrusion and to filter or deny test attempts must be made prior to testing to mitigate the risk of corrupting the test result data as well as changing the alarm status of monitoring personnel or agents. It may be necessary to coordinate these tests with the appropriate personnel within the scope. 10.3.1 Monitoring (a) Test whether telecommunications are monitored by an authoritative party for relaying improper network data, code injections, malicious content and improper conduct, and record responses and response time. (b) Test whether controls are in place for monitoring fraudulent activities or services tampering, and record responses and response time such as in periodic billing reconciliation using Call Detail Records (CDR). 10.3.2 Filtering (a) Test whether network-level controls are in place for blocking unauthorized activities and record responses and response time such as access filters based on Call Line Identification (CLID),", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 108}}
