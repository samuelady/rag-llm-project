A simple self-assessment can create a margin of operation errors caused during the test which the Analyst can use to either frame the thoroughness of the current audit or other audits of similar systems. Since it is a self assessment it will have a tendency to be biased. The Analyst should take great care for it to be as factual as possible as a form of quality assurance of the test and the test process. Although some may try to dismiss test errors which were on the fault of the Analyst, keeping track of all errors can only improve future tests and is not something to hide. Errors will happen and are no more than the Analyst’s attempt to interact with an ever-changing system. Regardless of the number and severity of errors, the tracking of test errors will serve as a record of the difficulty and complexity of the audit and the competency of the Analyst to deduce the errors. A record of test errors from the scope will also help sum up the environment in a simplistic way. It is a straight-forward reduction of the Executive Summary which often describes the Analyst’s opinion about the state of security wherein few to no errors will show a fairly static target and environment. Many errors show a chaotic environment and one that may lack controls for managing change or loss. Overall, test error records are useful for understanding the complexity of the audit and change control between audits of regular intervals.

Recommended solutions may be provided as a value-add to a security test but are not considered mandatory. Often there are no proper solutions based on the limited view an Analyst has of the client environment. Therefore, solutions are not required as part of an OSSTMM audit. Frequently, a test will exceed the limits of a security control. Within an engagement, the Analyst must always report the factual current state of security, any limitations within that current state, and any of the processes which caused those limitations of the applied controls and protections. To measure both the thoroughness of the test and the security of the target, use of this methodology should conclude with the Security Test Audit Report (STAR), available within this manual or at the ISECOM website. STAR requires the following information: 1. Date and time of test 2. Duration of test 3. Names of responsible Analysts 4. Test type 5. Scope of test 6. Index (method of target enumeration) 7. Channel tested 8. Test Vector 9. Attack surface metric 10. Which tests have been completed, not completed, or partially completed, and to what extent 11. Any issues regarding the test", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 38}}
