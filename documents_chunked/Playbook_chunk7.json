Create trust zones in the network where no system is directly accessible to another system. Ex: Desktops should not be able to connect to other desktops and network shares should be closed. Even if it’s on the same network, no system should be able to reach another system unless you planned for it to. Have all desktops connect to a fileserver to store documents. Make sure all administrative access ports like SSH on servers or administrative web access on intranet servers are only be reachable by the administrator’s system or, even better, manually on that server’s keyboard if it’s a local server. This is the network-level version of least privilege where only those who should access a particular document, printer, file server, or resource should be allowed to. THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 2: THE GAME PLAN 12 4. Create system zones in addition to people zones. When you make zones of who can access what you are giving authorization to specific people and what they can do with their system. However, there is an inherent weakness in this type of zone: trust. Many types of attacks, like phishing attacks, use the trusts of a particular user to gain access to other systems without the user having any idea it’s happening. You want to make sure that any resource accessed is done so by the person authorized to do so, and not secretly from their compromised system. One of the most common technologies to help you do this is CAPTCHA, which makes you prove you’re human. In addition, it will reduce web comment SPAN and brute-force attacks (exhaustive attempts to guess passwords) on authentication systems. 5. Avoid all-in-one networked systems. Examples are network access storage (NAS) + printer, or router + wi-fi. These systems are inherently weaker because they are more difficult to securely configure and more difficult to zone by filtering who is authorized to use them. If your router has wi-fi built in, disable it and instead use a wi-fi router in a special zone which cannot connect to internal systems. 6. Maintain a rigorous patching schedule for systems that are connected directly to the Internet. While racing to patch should not be a primary defense, for Internet-facing services it’s one of the few ways you can protect a server. For non-Internet-facing systems, you will want to make patching and other updates part of a regular maintenance schedule rather than automatically implementing them all the time. This will give you time to test the patches and updates on the standard system first, as well as create a routine in your network traffic that will help you identify malicious installs. 7. Create zones in your desktops, servers, and mobile devices that separate what can execute and what can read/write.
