{"text": "are potentially dealing with Remote-Code Execution. Recommendation The most effective solution to eliminating file inclusion vulnerabilities is to avoid passing raw user-submitted input to any filesystem API. If this is not possible, the application can maintain a white list of files that may be included by the page, and then check to see if the user input matches against any of the entries in the white list. Any request containing an invalid identifier has to be rejected. In this way, there is no attack surface for malicious users to manipulate the path.

The vulnerability is caused by improper input sanitization and allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands and execute them directly on the database. Risk description The risk exists that an attacker gains unauthorized access to the information from the database of the application. He could extract and alter information such as: application usernames, passwords, client information and other application specific data. Recommendation We recommend implementing a validation mechanism for all the data received from the users. The best way to protect against SQL Injection is to use prepared statements for every SQL query performed on the database. Otherwise, the user input can also be sanitized using dedicated methods such as: mysqli_real_escape_string. 15\\nReferences https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_She et.html Classification Category ID / Value CWE CWE-89 OWASP Top 10 - 2017 A1 - Injection OWASP Top 10 - 2021 A3 - Injection Verification ✔ This finding was validated so it is not a False Positive. 16\\n4.1.3 OS Command Injection Affected target https://pentest-ground.com:4280/ Status: Open Evidence URL https://pentest-ground.com:4280/vulnerabilities/exec/ Method POST Vulnerable Parameter ip (Body Parameter) Evidence Injected the echo ttp1739356543.6927|rev|sed -e 's/^/ptt/' -e 's/\\./dot/'|tr a-z A-Z command in the ip body parameter and found the expected command output (PTT7296DOT3456539371PTT) in the response To validate the vulnerability, we extracted", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Sample-Pentest-Engagement-Report-group-by-target", "chunk_id": 2}}
