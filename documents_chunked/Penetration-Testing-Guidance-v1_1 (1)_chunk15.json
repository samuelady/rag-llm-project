{"text": "of scope or isolated from the CDE, a representative subset can be used for testing to reduce the number of segmentation checks that need to be performed. Each unique segmentation methodology should be tested to ensure that all security controls are functioning as intended. If it is determined during the segmentation check that a LAN segment thought to be out of scope has access into the CDE, the organization will either need to adjust the segmentation controls to block that access, or perform a full network-layer penetration test to characterize the access and the impact on PCI DSS scope. 4.2.4 What to do when cardholder data is encountered If cardholder data is accessed during the penetration test, it is important that the tester notify the organization immediately. The tester should keep detailed documentation as to exactly what data was accessed and how it was accessed. After being notified, the organization should immediately review how the cardholder data was retrieved and, as appropriate, should take steps to execute its incident response plan. If the output of testing tools or activities includes cardholder data that was accessed by the tester during the engagement, it is important this output be secured in accordance with PCI DSS. 4.2.5 Post-Exploitation The term “post-exploitation” refers to the actions taken after the initial compromise of a system or device. It often describes the methodical approach of using privilege escalation or pivoting techniques—which allows the tester, in this case, to establish a new source of attack from the new vantage point in the system—to gain additional access to systems or network resources. Penetration testers should be able to demonstrate the risk presented by exploitable systems to the CDE and what post-exploitation may likely occur with those systems. 4.3 Post-Engagement After the engagement or testing has been performed, there are activities both parties should carry out. 4.3.1 Remediation Best Practices Penetration testing efforts, while thorough, may not always guarantee exhaustive identification of every instance where a security control’s effectiveness is insufficient—e.g., finding a cross site scripting vulnerability in one area of an application may not reveal all instances of this vulnerability in the application. Often the presence of vulnerability in one area may indicate weakness in process or development practices that could have replicated or enabled similar vulnerability in other locations. Therefore, it is important for the tested entity to carefully investigate systems or applications with the ineffective security controls in mind when remediating. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 19\\n4.3.2 Retesting Identified Vulnerabilities The organization should take steps to remediate any exploitable vulnerability within a reasonable period of time after the original test. When the organization has completed these steps, the tester should perform a retest to validate the newly implemented controls mitigate the original risk. Remediation efforts extending for a long period after the initial test may require a new testing engagement to be performed to ensure accurate results of the most current environment are reported.
