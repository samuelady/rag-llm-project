This channel covers the involvement of computer systems, primarily the operating networks within the target scope or framework. While some organizations consider this simply as “penetration testing”, the true compliance objective of security testing in this channel is system interaction and operational quality testing with gap measurements to the required security standard outlined in company policy, industry regulations, or regional legislation. During testing, end operators and artificial intelligence can recognize on-going attacks both by process and signature. For this reason, the Analyst will be required to have a sufficient variety of methods to avoid disclosure of the tests or work with the operators to assure that where security fails and where it succeeds is brought to light. Tests which focus only on the discovery of new problems only leave room for fixes and not designs for future improvements. Competent Analysts will require adequate networking knowledge, diligent security testing skills, and critical thinking skills to assure factual data collection creates factual results through correlation and analysis. Considerations Please note the following considerations to assure a safe, high quality test: 1. Ignorantia legis neminem excusat: Analysts who do not do proper posture review for the scope as well as the regions targeted for business or interactions may not escape punishment for violating laws merely because they were unaware of the law; that is, persons have presumed knowledge of the law. Analysts are considered professionals in this subject matter and, therefore,", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 115}}
