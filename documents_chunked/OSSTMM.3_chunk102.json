(b) Create a heat map of the scope showing all sources of the radiation and their radii and strength. (c) Test for sources that interact without authorization. (d) Collect information broadcast by these sources. (e) Map all found data to the emission limit values currently required in the region for all detected radiation. 9.4.2 Active Signal Detection Examine which frequencies or electromagnetic signal broadcasts trigger responses such as that from RFID or other interactive wireless sources. (Radio Frequency Identifier tags are composed of an integrated circuit, which is sometimes half the size of a grain of sand, and an antenna – usually a coil of wires. Information is stored on the integrated circuit and transmitted via the antenna when probed by the right signal. The exact frequencies used in RFID systems may therefore vary by country or region.)

While access to personnel outside of the scope is a real scenario and one often used for information property theft, the Analyst may be limited to scope-only interaction to protect the independent privacy rights of the personnel in their private life. 9.5.1 Evaluate Administrative Access to Wireless Devices Determine if access points are turned off during portions of the day when they will not be in use. 9.5.2 Evaluate Device Configuration Test and document using directional and high-gain antennas that wireless devices are set to the lowest possible power setting to maintain sufficient operation that will keep transmissions within the secure boundaries of the organization. 9.5.3 Evaluate Configuration, Authentication, and Encryption of Wireless Networks Verify that the access point’s default Service Set Identifier (SSID) has been changed. 9.54 Authentication Enumerate and test for inadequacies in authentication and authorization methods. 9.5.5 Access Control Evaluate access controls, perimeter security, and ability to intercept or interfere with communication, determining the level of physical access controls to access points and devices controlling", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 102}}
