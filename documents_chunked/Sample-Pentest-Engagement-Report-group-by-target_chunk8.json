Recommendation Whenever a cookie contains sensitive information or is a session token, then it should always be passed using an encrypted channel. Ensure that the flag is set for cookies containing such sensitive information. 34\\nReferences https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/stable/4- Web_Application_Security_Testing/06-Session_Management_Testing/02- Testing_for_Cookies_Attributes.html Classification Category ID / Value CWE CWE-614 OWASP Top 10 - 2017 A6 - Security Misconfiguration OWASP Top 10 - 2021 A5 - Security Misconfiguration Verification ✔ This finding was validated so it is not a False Positive. 35\\n4.1.10 Server Information disclosure Affected target https://pentest-ground.com:4280/ Status: Open Evidence URL https://pentest-ground.com:4280/?=PHPB8B5F2A0- 3C92-11d3-A3A9-4C7B08C10000 Page Title Welcome :: Damn Vulnerable Web Page Size 5.79 KB Summary PHP reveals potentially sensitive information via certain HTTP requests that contain specific QUERY strings. Vulnerability description We noticed that the target application is revealing server and backend application information through certain files. This type of information disclosure is typically due to insufficient data protection measures, leading to unintended exposure of sensitive server details. Risk description The risk is that an attacker could use these files to find information about the backend application, server software and their specific versions. This information could be further used to mount targeted attacks against the server. 36\\nRecommendation We recommend you to remove these scripts if they are not needed for business purposes.

For example, an attempt to exploit a path traversal weakness (CWE-22) might yield the full pathname of the installed application. Recommendation It is recommended treating all exceptions of the application flow. Ensure that error messages only contain minimal details.
