{"text": "place for guessing when measuring an attack surface. In addition to information about the test itself as to how it was made, the Analyst will need to report the following 7 test results: 1. Unknowns As more vectors and channels are analyzed, more information will be available and that which is reported will change and provide actionable intelligence. Conversely, maybe more results are inconclusive or the correlation of results provide conflicting answers, the resulting actionable intelligence is unknown. Unknown is a valid answer to report. What cannot be known is as valid and as important in security as what is discovered. What is unknown shows what is difficult to test or analyze. The unknown need not be seen as a failure of the tester rather it may be caused by superior protection or an attack that uses a large cost of time or resources not possible in a test. No Analyst should fear reporting something is unknown. It is a powerful result to base further risk analysis upon. 2. Untested Targets Additionally, the Analyst needs to report another type of unknown - targets in the scope which have not been tested in a particular vector or channel. If a test cannot be completed because of time constraints, tool limitations, targets being unstable, the test environment being too dynamic or too noisy to collect proper results, or because the tests were not wanted by the target owner then this needs to be known. By reporting what was not tested, it is possible to do proper test comparisons with future tests. It will also help avoid cheating by only testing the well protected segment of a scope and ignoring the rest to create the illusion of a small attack surface. 3. Identified and Verified Limitations Besides unknowns, the Analyst must also report any identified and verified limitations such as vulnerabilities in the targets. An identified limitation is one which has been determined through knowledge and correlation. This is useful when the tests themselves are dangerous or very costly. Sometimes a test can be damaging to a target or cause unacceptable or even criminal collateral damage. A verified limitation is one where the problem has been specifically tested to determine if it exists. 4. False Positives and the Means to Generate Them During tests, some identified limitations will not be vulnerable to those particular attacks during verification. This, however does not conclude that the target does not have those limitations. It only means that particular test at that particular time and from that particular tester did not expose the vulnerability as identified. It could also mean the target is vulnerable but is protected by a particular control. Such determined false positives should be reported so that during further development of protective and defensive techniques, the problem can be looked at more closely, particularly from a different vector.
