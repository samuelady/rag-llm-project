THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 3: LOOKING DOWNFIELD 25 The Big Picture In cybersecurity, you’re dealing with conflicting information from authorities struggling themselves to understand what makes or defines “good” security. Some of the most common questions leave most security professionals simply guessing as to what’s the right answer: Is it more secure to harden servers or use a firewall? When do you need two-factor authentication? Which is better security, certificates or passwords? Do reverse proxies actually provide more security? That said, cybersecurity is also maturing as a field. Every year, there’s less misinformation and more and more people trying to come to terms with the fact that they were at least a little wrong last year. But humility is not for everyone, and security is a humbling experience for everyone. It’s like in sports how you can keep thinking it was a great game right up until the point when you wondering how you lost. Things don’t tend to just gradually grow bad — they suddenly do, surprisingly so, from one breath to the next, the same way you go from running like a gazelle to sliding across the ground with no idea why you fell. Luckily, the online cybersecurity community has more advice than you ever need — even if it does conflict a lot. And one of the great things about such a huge, helpful, self-interested community of humbled people is that they really want to help. But you need to be careful with that if you want to really set yourself up for long-term success. What happens is that by relying on the cybersecurity community for your answers you will ultimately get mostly the answers that allow the security community, especially vendors to profit. This skews the directions future security research takes. It skews the tools that security vendors make and sell. Most of all, it skews the knowledge you need to know in order to improve your own security. What you’ll eventually learn is that good security professionals tell you what you want to know. But great security professionals tell you what you need to", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Playbook", "chunk_id": 17}}
