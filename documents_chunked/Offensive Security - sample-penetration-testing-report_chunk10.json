{"text": "local administrator password on all hosts within the scope of the GPO. Using the same local administrator password on corporate systems allows an attacker with appropriate access to utilize the well-known “pass-the-hash” attack vector. It allows an attacker to successfully authenticate on all hosts that share the same password, using only the retrieved password hash. As such, the attack does not rely on successful decryption of the hash and it significantly increases the security breach footprint. Remediation: It is highly recommended to disable all local administrator accounts. In cases where a local administrative account is necessary, it should be assigned a unique name and a complex random password. PTR-20130513 Copyright © 2013 Offensive Security Services LLC.

Impact: A combination of weak authentication and unpatched hosts, which contain known vulnerabilities with publicly available exploits, allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a large number of MegaCorp One’s assets. Specifically, discovered instance of SQLite Manager is vulnerable to a remote code execution vulnerability and the underlying host also contains a local privilege escalation vulnerability, which can easily be leveraged to compromise the externally exposed host entirely. This appears to be an indication of an insufficient patch management policy and its implementation. Remediation: All corporate assets should be kept current with latest vendor-supplied security patches. This can be achieved with vendor-native tools or third-party applications, which can provide an overview of all missing patches. In many instances, third-party tools can also be used for patch deployment throughout a heterogeneous environment. DNS Zone Transfer Rating: Low Description: A misconfigured DNS server allows unrestricted zone transfers. Impact: A DNS server, which is configured to allow zone transfers to any DNS server, can provide sensitive information about corporate assets and network layouts. Remediation: DNS zone transfers should be restricted only to pre-approved servers. Default Apache Files Rating: Low Description: Default Apache files were discovered on the admin.megacorpone.com host. Impact: An attacker may be able to guess the exact version of the running Apache server by inspecting the contents of the default files. Additional sensitive information may also be available. Remediation: Remove all default files from publicly accessible web servers. PTR-20130513 Copyright © 2013 Offensive Security Services LLC. All rights reserved.

Penetration testing for coverage has risen in popularity in recent years as a simplified method of assessments used in situations where the goal is to meet regulatory needs. As a form of vulnerability scanning, penetration testing for coverage includes selective verification of discovered issues through exploitation. This allows service providers the ability to conduct the work largely through the use of automated toolsets and maintain consistency of product across multiple engagements. Penetration testing for impact is a form of attack simulation under controlled conditions, which closely mimics the", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Offensive Security - sample-penetration-testing-report", "chunk_id": 10}}
