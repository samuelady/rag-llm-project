{"text": "convictions, and anything that will give a good representation as to how transparent that person is. The final calculation however has to be the sum total of all tests which will provide a single transparency percentage for that rule. The resulting percentage for each trust rule can be viewed individually to show where controls must be applied to improve or maintain necessary levels of trustworthiness. This may also show where improvements must be made before a trust can be considered. For example, a trust analysis for a costly and difficult military campaign may show that rule four, subjugation, is at 10% because some of the necessary participants are civilians and not under military control. This gives the theater operators of the campaign specific, actionable information to make the necessary adjustments to get that percentage up to a level that’s acceptable or else apply more controls to better assure compliance from those civilian members. Another result from analyzing the percentages of individual trust rules is that unknowns become glaringly Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution-Non-Commercial-NoDerivs 2010, ISECOM, www.isecom.org, www.osstmm.org 91\\nobvious because the less that is known, the lower the percentage will be. This means unknowns will be at or very close to 0%. The end metric however is one which is the mean of all percentages. This provides a big picture understanding you could rationally have of the target of the trust. This is especially useful when it is difficult to make a trust decision because of personal bias. Use of trust rules in formal security analysis as well as regular decision making can greatly minimize bias and mistakes. Therefore, the Analyst should be practiced in this skill so as to be able to apply them quickly so that it can be used even in high-pressure or emergency situations where a snap decision is necessary and a wrong decision is tragedy. Example Trust Rules This is a sample of generic trust rules anyone can employee to make better hiring decisions beyond that of just the technical qualification of the applicant. It follows the 10 trust properties. The goal is to make quantifiable questions which can be answered for each of the properties and applied by any person and on any potential new hire. Solid trust rules allows for consistency in quality rather than relying on the “gut instinct” of the gate keepers who need to make the trust decisions. 1. Size: 1.1. Calculate the applicant divided by the total group of applicants. 1.2. Calculate the number of people the applicant appears to know in the group divided by total applicants from the total group. 1.3. Calculate the number of current employees the applicant knows (and is “friends” with) in this location and divide it by the total number of employees in this location. 1.4. Record the average of these results. 2. Symmetry: 2.1. The number of people the applicant must rely on to do their job in this position (including the applicant) divided by the number of professionals who must rely on the", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 74}}
