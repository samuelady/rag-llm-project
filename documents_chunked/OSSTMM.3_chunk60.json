More simply, in HUMSEC, a non-repudiation process where the person must sign a register and provide an identification number to receive a document is under Subjugation controls when the provider of the document records the identification number, rather than having the receiver do so, to eliminate the recording of a false number with a false name.

Continuity is the umbrella term for characteristics such as survivability, load balancing, and redundancy. In a PHYSSEC audit, if it is discovered that an entry way into a store 4 Continuity becomes blocked such that no alternate entry way is possible and customers cannot enter, that Access does not have Continuity. In a COMSEC data networks audit, if a web server service fails from high- load and an alternate web server provides redundancy so no interactions are lost, this Access has Continuity. Count each instance for Access or Trust in the scope that does not fail open or provide new accesses upon security failure. In common language, to “fail securely”. In a PHYSSEC audit where 2 guards control Access to a door, if one is removed and the door cannot be opened by the remaining guard, then 5 Resilience it has resilience. In a COMSEC data networks audit, if a web service requiring a log-in or password loses communication with its authentication database, then all Access should be denied rather than permitted in order to have resilience. Count each instance for the Access or Trust that provides a non- repudiation mechanism for each interaction to provide assurance that the particular interaction did occur at a particular time between the identified parties. Non-repudiation depends upon identification and authorization to be properly established for it to be properly applied without limitations. In a PHYSSEC audit, the Non-repudiation control exists if the entrance to a building requires a camera with a biometric face scan to gain entry and each time it is used, the time of entry is recorded with the ID. However, if a key-card is used instead, the Non-repudiation control requires a 6 Non-repudiation synchronized, time-coded camera to assure the record of the card-user’s identity to avoid being a flawed implementation. If the door is tried without the key card, not having the synchronized camera monitoring the door would mean that not all interactions with the entryway have the Non-repudiation control and therefore does not count for this control. In a COMSEC data networks audit, there may be multiple log files for non- repudiation. A port scan interacting at the IP Stack is recorded in one log while interaction with the web service is recorded to another log file.
