{"text": "the ravs is to understand how much of the attack surface is exposed. In this scale, 100 rav (also shown as 100% rav for simplicity of understanding although not precisely a percentage) is perfect balance and anything less is too few controls and therefore a greater attack surface. More than 100 rav shows more controls than are necessary which itself may be a problem as controls often add interactions within a scope as well as complexity and maintenance issues. The rav does not measure risk for an attack surface, rather it enables the measurement of it. It cannot say if a particular target will be attacked however it can say where on a target it will be attacked, what types of attacks the target can successfully defend against, how deep an attacker can get, and how much damage can be done. With that information it is then possible to assess the trusts (and risks) much more accurately. The rav is actually multiple separate calculations of Porosity, Controls, and Limitations, that when combined will show the size of an attack surface in two practical ways. The first way is in a straight calculation. It is the calculation of the Delta, a number that describes the specific exposure of that target. This is useful for determining how a new person, thing, or process will change the operational security of a new scope or as a comparison between multiple, single targets. This is also the easiest way to see Perfect Security, the perfect balance between Porosity, Controls, and Limitations. The rav is displayed as a positive or negative number which shows how far away the target is from a perfect security balance. A positive delta shows too much is spent on controls in general or even if the overspending is on too much of one type of control. A negative delta shows a lack of controls or controls themselves with limitations which cannot protect the target adequately. This is a powerful tool for knowing exactly where and how resources are being spent to protect a particular target. However this is not how the rav is most useful; that is done best the second way. The second practical way to display the attack surface is for understanding the big picture. This is represented as Actual Security. Where the Delta calculation is based on perfect balance, the Actual Security calculation uses the Delta but also includes additional and redundant controls to provide a metric more people friendly and familiar. Here the rav representation is similar to how people use percentages. The rav is calculated with a base 10 logarithm, which makes a more comprehensible representation. While the rav is still a balance, perfect balance is set at 100 and calculations are made in respect to that. This will allow most people to have a quick and easy overview of all the targets in a scope or of just a single target in relation to other targets. It is extremely flexible so multiple attack surfaces can", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 51}}
