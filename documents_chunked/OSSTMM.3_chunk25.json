{"text": "vectors. Each vector should ideally be a separate test to keep each compartmentalized test duration short before too much change can occur within the environment. 5. Identify what equipment will be needed for each test. Inside each vector, interactions may occur on various levels. These levels may be classified in many ways, however here they have been classified by function as five channels. The channels are Human, Physical, Wireless, Telecommunications, and Data Networks. Each channel must be separately tested for each vector. 6. Determine what information you want to learn from the test. Will you be testing interactions with the assets or also the response from active security measures? The test type must be individually defined for each test, however there are six common types identified here as Blind, Double Blind, Gray Box, Double Gray Box, Tandem, and Reversal. 7. Assure the security test you have defined is in compliance to the Rules of Engagement, a guideline to assure the process for a proper security test without creating misunderstandings, misconceptions, or false expectations. The end result will be a measurement of your Attack Surface. The attack surface is the unprotected part of the Scope from a defined Vector.

The scope is comprised of three classes of which there are five channels: Telecommunications and Data Networks security Channels of the COMSEC class, Physical and Human Security Channels of the PHYSSEC class, and the full spectrum Wireless Security Channel of the SPECSEC class. Classes are from official designations currently in use in the security industry, government, and the military. Classes are used to define an area of study, investigation, or operation. However, Channels are the specific means of interacting with assets. An asset can be anything that has value to the owner. Assets can be physical property like gold, people, blueprints, laptops, the typical 900 MHz frequency phone signal, and money; or intellectual property such as personnel data, a relationship, a brand, business processes, passwords, and something which is said over the 900 MHz phone signal. Often, the scope extends far beyond the reach of the asset owner as dependencies are beyond the asset ownerâ€™s ability to provide independently. The scope requires that all threats be considered possible, even if not probable. Although, it must be made clear that a security analysis must be restricted to that which is within a type of certainty (not to be confused with risk which is not a certainty but a probability). These restrictions include: 1. Non-events such as a volcano eruption where no volcano exists, 2. Non-impact like moonlight through data center window, or 3. Global-impacting such as a catastrophic meteor impact. While a thorough security audit requires testing all five channels, realistically, tests are conducted and categorized by the required expertise of the Analyst and the required equipment", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 25}}
