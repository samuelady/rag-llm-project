Equipment can range from rope to climb walls to SCUBA gear to travel under water. Equipment types are not limited to just the environment but also the barriers one must circumvent. (b) Verify damaged safety equipment which may lead to Analyst injury. (c) Examine the targets for hazardous, contaminated, or poorly maintained terrain, air, water, buildings, or structures. (d) Examine noise, electromagnetic radiation, and magnetic field levels at the scope. 8.2.2 Communications (a) Test which languages are used within the scope and which languages are communicated between the scope and the customers, partners, and resellers outside the scope. (b) Examine the means of communication between personnel and whether it is enhanced through the use of tools such as flags, flares, radios, binoculars, night vision, etc. 8.2.3 Time (a) Test for the timezone, holidays, and work schedules for various roles and jobs within the scope including partners, resellers, and influential customers interacting with the scope. (b) Determine if decreased mobility or visibility during time of day, week, month, or season (day or night, fog, rain, or snow) will have an impact upon operations at the target.

The date and time of entry as well as departure of the target should be recorded. (b) Determine the range of the monitoring and whether the travel of a threat to the target can be intercepted in a timely manner. (c) Verify if travel to the target requires increased time on target and exposure. This includes, but is not limited to: quarantine rooms, long empty hallways, parking lots, large empty expanses, difficult or unnatural terrain, and guest or holding areas. (d) Verify that the lighting and visible contrast on approach to the target allows for interception of threats. 8.3.2 Reacting (a) Verify", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 92}}
