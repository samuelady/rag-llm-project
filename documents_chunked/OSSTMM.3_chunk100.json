ELSEC are the measures to deny unauthorized access to information derived from the interception and analysis of non-communications electromagnetic radiations. SIGSEC are the measures to protect wireless communications from unauthorized access and jamming. EMSEC are the measures to prevent the machine emanations that, if intercepted and analyzed, would disclose the information transmitted, received, handled, or otherwise processed by information systems equipment. Testing this channel requires interaction with barriers to assets over Electromagnetic (EM) and Microwave (MW) frequencies. This channel covers the interaction of the Analyst within proximity range of the targets. While some services consider this simply as “scanning”, the true compliance objectives of security testing in this channel are physical and logical barrier testing and gap measurement to the required security standard outlined in company policy, industry regulations, or regional legislation. The Analyst will be required to have adequate protection from electromagnetic power sources and other forms of radiation. Analysts will also need to be prepared for the possibility of accidental bodily harm from exposure to electromagnetic and microwave radiation, especially that which can permanently damage hearing or sight. Proper equipment should warn when within range of Electromagnetic and Microwave radiation from -12dB and greater. Specific frequencies may adversely affect implanted medical devices, cause vertigo, headaches, stomach cramps, diarrhea, and other discomforts on both an emotional and physical level. Competent Analysts will require sufficient knowledge of EM and MW radiation and critical thinking skills to assure factual data collection creates factual results through correlation and analysis. Considerations Please note the following considerations to assure a safe, high quality test: 1. Ignorantia legis neminem excusat: Analysts who do not do proper posture review for the scope as well as the regions targeted for business or interactions may not escape punishment for violating laws merely because they were unaware of the law; that is, Analysts have presumed knowledge of the law. Analysts are considered professionals in this subject matter and, therefore, the assumption exists that even regarding what may not be common knowledge for the average person about a foreign region’s laws regarding EM and MW communication systems, will be known to", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 100}}
