Classification Category ID / Value CWE CWE-200 OWASP Top 10 - 2017 A6 - Security Misconfiguration OWASP Top 10 - 2021 A5 - Security Misconfiguration Verification ✘ 69\\n4.2 Target: pentest-ground.com 4.2.1 Redis - Remote Code Execution (CVE-2022-0543) Affected target pentest-ground.com Status: Open Port: 6379 Evidence We managed to detect this vulnerability by evaluating the payload that contains the id command: eval 'local io_l = package.loadlib(\"/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/liblua5.1.so.0\", \"luaopen_io\"); local io = io_l(); local f = io.popen(\"id\", \"r\"); local res = f:read(\"*a\"); f:close(); return res' 0 Data received: uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) Vulnerability description We found that the target server is vulnerable to CVE-2022-0543, a Remote Code Execution vulnerability in the Redis caching service. The root cause of this vulnerability consists in an unexpected sandbox escape on Debian systems because of the dynamically load of the Lua interpreter. Therefore, an unauthenticated remote attacker can connect to the Redis service, evaluate a library load and execute shell commands. We have detected this vulnerability by connecting to the Redis service, loading liblua5.1.so.0 library, executing id command and reading the command response from the output. Risk description The risk exists that a remote unauthenticated attacker can fully compromise the server in order to steal confidential information, install ransomware or pivot to the internal network. 70\\nRecommendation We recommend upgrading the Redis service to a version equal to or higher than 5:5.0.14-1+deb10u2 for the oldstable version, or 5:5.0.14-1+deb10u2 for the stable distribution.

This vulnerability is affecting the WLS subcomponent because the path of /ws_utc/config.do is reachable without authentication, meaning that the Weblogic server is in the development mode. The attacker can set a new Work Home Directory which needs to be writable and then upload JKS Keystores, which are Java Server Pages (JSP) files. Uploading a webshell as a JKS, the attacker can successfully achieve Remote Code Execution on the server. We have detected this vulnerability by changing the Work Home Directory to a writable one sending an HTTP POST request, then uploading the webshell as a command interpreter with an HTTP POST request, and finally sending an HTTP GET request to the webshell to read the command response from the output. 72\\nRisk description The risk exists that a remote unauthenticated attacker can fully compromise the server in order to steal confidential information, install ransomware, or pivot to the internal network.
