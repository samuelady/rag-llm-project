(Inbound) Core Networking - Router Advertisement (ICMPv6-In) c. (Outbound) Core Networking - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6(DHCPV6- Out) 2. If WPAD is not in use internally, disable it via Group Policy and by disabling the WinHttpAutoProxySvc service. 3. Relaying to LDAP and LDAPS can only be mitigated by enabling both LDAP signing and LDAP channel binding. Consider Administrative users to the Protected Users group or marking them as Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated, which will prevent any impersonation of that user via delegation. Demo Corp BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL Page 18 of 38\\nFinding IPT-007: Insufficient Hardening – SMB Signing Disabled (Critical) Description: Demo Corp failed to implement SMB signing on multiple devices. The absence of SMB signing could lead to SMB relay attacks, yielding system-level shells without requiring a user password. Risk: Likelihood: High – Relaying password hashes is a basic technique not requiring offline cracking. Impact: High – If exploited, an adversary gains code execution, leading to lateral movement across the network. System: Identified 709 machines, please see the below file for listing.

Alternatively, as SMB signing can cause performance issues, disabling NTLM authentication, enforcing account tiering, and limiting local admin users can effectively help mitigate attacks.

Demo Corp BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL Page 19 of 38\\nFinding IPT-008: Insufficient Patch Management – Software (Critical) Description: Demo Corp permitted various deprecated software in their network. This includes: • Apache version < 2.4.46 • Apache Tomcat version < 7.0.100, 8.5.51, 9.0.31 • Cisoco AireOS version 8.5.151.10 • CodeMeter version 3.05 (5.21.1478.500) • Dropbear SSH Server version 2015.68 • Dell iDRAC7 version 2.63.60.62.01 • Dell iDRAC8 version 2.63.60.61.06 • Dell iDRAC9 version 3.36.36.36.21 • ESXi version 5.5 • ESXi version 6.5 build 15256549 • Flexera FlexNet Publisher version 11.16.0 • IIS version 7.5 • ISC BIND version 9.6.2-P2 • Microsoft DNS Server version 6.1.7601.24261 • Microsoft SQL Server version 11.0.6594.0 • Netatalk OpenSession version < 3.1.12 • PHP version < 7.3.11 • Rockwell Automation RSLinx Classic Above lists all critical and high-rated deprecated software, the majority of which permit serious vulnerabilities, such as remote code execution. For a full patching list, please review the provided Nessus scan documentation. Risk: Likelihood: High – An attacker can discover these vulnerabilities with basic tools. Impact: Very High – If exploited, an attacker could possibly gain full remote code execution on or deny service to a system. Tools Used: Nessus References: NIST SP800-53 r4 MA-6 – Timely Maintenance NIST SP800-53 r4 SI-2 – Flaw Remediation Remediation Update to the latest software version.
