{"text": "product. While this statement is meant to inform those who think of security in terms of products, this catchphrase actually uses the fallacies of False Dilemma and Presumption to persuade. As a False Dilemma, it states that there are only two choices, a product and a process and therefore security must be one or the other. As a Presumption, the conclusion of the statement is already presumed as a process being the means to security. Together, these fallacies do not allow for products and processes to combine in the formation of security nor does it allow for something else entirely different. In reality, the public definition of security is ill defined and not actually achievable, which is the likely reason for all these axioms in the first place. This leaves room for many interpretations of what security can be and the main reason why the Analyst must commit to an achievable, measurable definition of security. To state then that security is one thing or another is false especially when security itself is undefined and lends itself to standard, dictionary interpretations. It is also why this manual clearly defines security as something measurable. An Analyst is required to apply critical security thinking skills to information as it is provided as well as to statements which are made about the analyzed information to form factual intelligence. Intelligence created in such a manner will provide accurate and unbiased metrics as well as a clear understanding of how security is deficient without the need for qualifiers. 3.2 Recognize the OpSec Model There are two problems with security analysis in practical use on operations. The first is that technology is often far ahead of every Analyst’s ability to understand how all of it works, if this know-how is even possible to obtain under the current closed-box status of most commercial technology products. The second problem is that ironically, the deconstruction of how something works, including business processes, may be illegal in order to protect the financial risk and privacy of the manufacturer from the buyer even though as a user of the product, the buyer may actually need that information to protect themselves from real threats which are probably not their customers. However, even in cases where a technology or process cannot be analyzed directly, the product can be analyzed within the environment with which it interacts. For each vector and channel that is analyzed, the Analyst will be putting an overlay of the OpSec model over the targets. To apply the OpSec model is simply to count the controls for each interactive point of Access or Trust as well as the discovery of opportunity in the form of Visibility. Where a target is an unknown like a black box which can’t be opened, the Analyst needs to address the controls over the system’s interactions in its environment. The process will look like this: 1. What is visible in the scope? What is of possible value that is known? What targets can be determined? 2.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 44}}
