{"text": "of eight possible ratings levels. To be most usable, ratings need to mirror ratings systems familiar to the technical teams. The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) list developed by MITRE or scores based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) will be familiar to all technical staff and are not too difficult to explain to executives. While these scores will lack the context of the business or active exploitation efforts, using standardized ratings as an initial base will typically be appreciated and easily understood. Tips and Cautions The main purpose of pentesting is to locate and remediate vulnerabilities before an attacker can exploit them. However, there are adjacent issues related to compliance and confidentiality that need to be considered for testing and reporting. Compliance Penetration Tests Generic pentests can check for vulnerabilities, but not necessarily touch on all elements to verify compliance. Some compliance standards require specific tests on specific systems and penetration testers should be told of such requirements in advance. Likewise the pen test report should reflect any compliance needs and specifically demonstrate the pen test results against specific compliance standards, either as the core of the penetration test results or within related appendices. The report should specifically demonstrate that the security for systems or processes protecting regulated data have been tested as required and the results of those required tests. Penetration Test Confidentiality Confidentiality is key to security. Yet a thorough penetration test result will include many confidential details (IP addresses, security tool settings, application code, etc.) that would seriously harm an organization if exposed. Confer with the client to determine the distribution needs for the report. If necessary, offer an edited or redacted version of the report that removes confidential information for broader distribution to non-privileged stakeholders (customers, vendors, affected executives, etc.). The client should also be consulted to determine the need for compliance-specific reports that contain only the pen test results for systems and assets touching the regulated data. If delivering reports electronically, consider encrypted or technologically restricted distribution (specific-user only permissions, etc.). Physical reports should be numbered and tracked. Pentest Report Checklist Ã— The preparation of a penetration test report can be stressful and it will be easy to miss critical steps in the stress of writing and the technical details.
