Information provided here does not iii\\n1 Introduction 1.1 Objective This information supplement provides general guidance and guidelines for penetration testing. The guidance focuses on the following:  Penetration Testing Components: Understanding of the different components that make up a penetration test and how this differs from a vulnerability scan including scope, application and network-layer testing, segmentation checks, and social engineering.  Qualifications of a Penetration Tester: Determining the qualifications of a penetration tester, whether internal or external, through their past experience and certifications.  Penetration Testing Methodologies: Detailed information related to the three primary parts of a penetration test: pre-engagement, engagement, and post-engagement.  Penetration Testing Reporting Guidelines: Guidance for developing a comprehensive penetration test report that includes the necessary information to document the test as well as a checklist that can be used by the organization or the assessor to verify whether the necessary content is included. The information in this document is intended as supplemental guidance and does not supersede, replace, or extend PCI DSS requirements. The current version of PCI DSS at the time of publication is v3.2; however, the general principles and practices offered here may also be applicable to other versions of PCI DSS. 1.2 Intended Audience This guidance is intended for entities that are required to conduct a penetration test whether they use an internal or external resource. In addition, this document is intended for companies that specialize in offering penetration test services, and for assessors who help scope penetration tests and review final test reports. The guidance is applicable to organizations of all sizes, budgets, and industries. 1.3 Terminology The following terms are used throughout this document:  Application-layer testing: Testing that typically includes websites, web applications, thick clients, or other applications.  Black-box testing: Testing performed without prior knowledge of the internal structure/design/implementation of the object being tested.  Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS): Provides an open framework for communicating the characteristics and impacts of IT vulnerabilities.  Grey-box testing: Testing performed with partial knowledge of the internal structure/design/implementation of the object being tested. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 4\\n National Vulnerability Database (NVD): The U.S. government repository of standards based vulnerability management data. This data enables automation of vulnerability management, security measurement, and compliance (e.g., FISMA).  Network-layer testing: Testing that typically includes external/internal testing of networks (LANS/VLANS), between interconnected systems, and wireless networks.  Penetration tester, tester, or team: The individual(s) conducting the penetration test for the entity. They may be a resource internal or external to the entity.  Social engineering: Manipulation or deception of individuals into", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Penetration-Testing-Guidance-v1_1", "chunk_id": 1}}
