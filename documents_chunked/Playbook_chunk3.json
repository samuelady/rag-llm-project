{"text": "Malvertising What it is: Marketers aren’t the only ones who like to utilize advertising to get in front of the crowds of website visitors. Criminals do the same thing, creating fake ads or inserting malicious code into legitimate ads so they can quite literally capture their audience. What makes protection a challenge: Online advertising is already incredibly prevalent and chances are it’s only going to grow more aggressive. At the same time, people are also becoming increasingly used to ads, including pop-ups, etc. and they’re no longer viewed with as much mistrust. In terms of protection, the quick knee-jerk reaction is to use ad-blocker software. Unfortunately, many websites don’t work unless you deactivate it. And if employees have to choose between their ad-blocker and a top 10 list of cat videos... THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 1: SCOUTING REPORTS 7 Zero-Day Attack What it is: Traditionally, a zero-day refers to any undisclosed vulnerability that attackers can exploit before victims and software vendors become aware of it and have the chance to patch it. The term “zero-day attack” is also sometimes more broadly applied to attacks that utilize new tactics, exploits, or malware variants that haven’t been seen before, giving them an advantage. What makes protection a challenge: It’s difficult to protect yourself against something you’ve never encountered before, especially if it blindsides you. Signature-based security solutions are particularly susceptible to getting bypassed by zero-day attacks since the way they identify malicious files is by comparing them to a list of previously captured malware samples to see if there’s a match. If an attack is using a never-before-seen exploit or piece of malware, there’s a good chance it’s going to claim a victim. Because of their effectiveness, zero-days are in high demand, and criminals have become increasingly incentivized to discover more of them. Unfortunately, that means uncovering and patching one vulnerability may only offer you momentary protection before attackers move on to exploiting the next one. Password Cracking What it is: A login and password isn’t what most people think it is. It’s actually a complicated set of processes that can involve multiple systems, secure transport to and from the servers, a trusted network of server identity assurance and revocation, code to evaluate the complexity of the user-generated password, more code to make sure the person entering the code is indeed a human, a secondary factor of authentication, and a means to recover lost passwords. So password cracking is more than just running a program to guess the password — it’s about cracking the password process to take over a user’s account. What makes protection a challenge: Any system that allows users to access it from anywhere and also requires those users to make, safeguard, and remember their own passwords is a system that’s going to be difficult (if not impossible) to defend. According to what OSSTMM researchers refer to as “The Somebody Sequence,” the more interaction somebody has in the security process, the greater its attack surface.
