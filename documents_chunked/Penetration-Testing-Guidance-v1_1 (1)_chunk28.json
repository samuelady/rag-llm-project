Cardholder data is collected as a card-present transaction by swiping or keying the card into a POS terminal. The information is then sent to a local server at each store before being sent out to the processor. No cardholder data is transmitted between stores or back to corporate. After receiving a confirmation from the processor, cardholder data is purged from the POS server. The POS server runs a PA-DSS point-of-sale application. Corporate has a persistent VPN connection into each of the store locations to allow for administration of networked resources, accessing CCTV recordings, and checking inventory. Description of Environment The environment at Green Clothing consists of six store locations and one corporate office. All stores were determined to be identically configured and have been segmented into two networks:  POS Network – Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) 2 POS devices o 1 POS server o  General Store Network (Non-CDE) 1 manager workstation o 1 CCTV server o Corporate is made up of two network segments:  Corporate General User Network (Non-CDE) 4 workstations o 1 wireless access point o  Corporate IT Management Network (Non-CDE) o 3 workstations used to manage CDE servers The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

Information provided here does not 36\\nExample Corporate Network Diagram Pre-Engagement Activities The POS networks at each store location are considered the cardholder data environment and are the target of the penetration test. The servers within this network at each store are the servers that store, process, and transmit cardholder data. Scoping Discussion It was discussed with Green Clothing company how they managed their CDE-environment, specifically how servers and databases are administrated. All administration is conducted from the IT network at corporate over the VPN connection. The following documentation was reviewed before the assessment:  A network diagram  Results from quarterly external and internal vulnerability scans  Results from the last penetration test  The scope of the Green Clothing’s last penetration test  Security policies  Review of Green Clothing’s risk analysis The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 37\\nFinal Scope Definition After review of all provided materials, Green Clothing and the penetration tester came to an agreement of the following scope definition. External Penetration Test Testing included evaluation of the following", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Penetration-Testing-Guidance-v1_1 (1)", "chunk_id": 28}}
