{"text": "fact now or ever. For example, some common axioms still in use will seem much less like golden rules and more like excuses when put to the light of critical security thing. These axioms are so common because there is a general inability to think critically about security or separate it from risk as a concept. Security is not about risk. It is about protection and controls. Risk is about risk. Risk is speculated, contrived, derived, and correlated. Risk is also subjective. Security should not be. To better understand how these qualifiers taint our ability to make good security analysis, we can examine the fallacies in the common qualifiers: 1. There is no such thing as 100% secure. The statement fails to provide conditions such as time and the metric for which percentages can be used as the scale. As a risk statement, it could hold true- “There is no such thing as always being 100% risk free.” because under the definition of risk, even our own bodies are subject to time and self-inflicted injuries. However as a security statement it can have far too many exceptions to be true. 2. Even if you are secure, if an attacker wants in badly enough they’ll get in. The statement fails to provide the condition of time, which for any human attacker would be finite, and includes a form of the equivocation fallacy which qualifies the attacker’s desire. Therefore, if no attacker has entered then they apparently didn’t want in “badly enough”. Furthermore, the statement makes a use of the phrase “get in” too broadly so that the idea is gaining entry but could be further applied to any number of potential, harmful attacks. 3. There is no perfect security. The statement fails to provide the condition of time implying the axiom means “ever” which is itself an absolute and difficult to prove. This short statement also falls into the categories of two logical fallacies, the Nirvana fallacy and the Perfect Solution fallacy. In the Nirvana fallacy, we are mislead to reject something because it cannot be perfect. However, it can be good enough for one’s needs. In the Perfect Solution fallacy, the argument assumes a perfect solution even exists. This assumption is easy to argue in terms of products for those who only understand security concepts in terms of products. In reality, “perfect” is a subjective concept and what may not be perfect for one person may indeed be perfect for another. Within the context of this manual, “perfect” means a perfectly balanced equation when calculating the attack surface consisting of OpSec and Limitations against Controls.

While this statement is meant to inform those who think of security in terms of products, this catchphrase actually uses the fallacies of False Dilemma and Presumption to persuade. As a False Dilemma, it states that there are only two choices, a product and a process and therefore security", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 43}}
