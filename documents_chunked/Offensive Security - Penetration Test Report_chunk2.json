{"text": "recommends patching the vulnerabilities identified during the penetration test to ensure that an attacker cannot exploit these systems in the future. One thing to remember is that these systems require frequent patching and once patched, should remain on a regular patch program in order to mitigate additional vulnerabilities that may be discovered at a later date. 3.0 Report – Methodologies OS-XXXXX utilized a widely adopted approach to performing penetration testing that is effective in testing how well the Offensive Security Labs and Exam environments are secure. Below is a summary of how OS-XXXXX was able to identify and exploit a number of systems. 5 | P a g e\\n3.1 Report – Information Gathering The information gathering portion of a penetration test focuses on identifying the scope of the penetration test. During this penetration test, OS-XXXXX was tasked with exploiting the lab and exam network. The specific IP addresses were: Lab Network 192.168.31.218 3.2 Report – Service Enumeration The service enumeration portion of a penetration test focuses on gathering information about what services are alive on a system or systems. This is valuable to an attacker as it provides detailed information on potential attack vectors into a system. Understanding what applications are running on the system provides an attacker with vital information before conducting the actual penetration test. In some cases, some ports may not be listed. Server IP Address Ports Open Service/Banner 192.168.31.218 TCP: 80, 3389 Apache / RDP 6 | P a g e\\n3.3 Report – Penetration The penetration testing portion of the assessment focuses heavily on gaining access to a variety of systems. During this penetration test, OS-XXXXX was able to successfully gain access to 10 out of the 50 systems. Vulnerability Exploited: KikChat - (LFI/RCE) Multiple Vulnerability System Vulnerable: 192.168.31.218 Vulnerability Explanation: The KikChat web application suffers from a Local File Include (LFI), as well as a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. A combination of these vulnerabilities was used to obtain a low privilege shell. Privilege Escalation Vulnerability: Named Pipe Impersonation (In Memory/Admin) Vulnerability Fix: No known patch or update for this issue. Severity: Critical Information Gathering: 7 | P a g e\\nFull Nmap scan of all ports: Nikto scan on target’s port 80: 8 | P a g e\\nContent of target’s robots.txt (using curl): Further enumeration of port 80 using a browser: Searching Exploit-DB for PoC on KikChat’s vulnerability: 9 | P a g e\\nProof Of Concept Code: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/30235/ Confirming RCE: Using the PoC from Exploit-DB, additional information about the web server is gathered by creating a php file with 'phpinfo()', and viewing it. Command issued from terminal: curl -s http://192.168.31.218/8678576453/rooms/get.php\\?name\\=info.php\\&ROOM\\=\"<?php+ phpinfo()+?>\" Viewing custom php file in the browser: 10 | P a g e\\nGetting Low-Privilege shell: Using the RCE vulnerability, create a php file called 'shell.php' that will download 'nc.txt'. Save it as a batch file, create 'nc.exe' and connect back to attacker: Hosting 'nc.txt' file: RCE command to download 'nc.txt', run 'shell.php', and connect to attacking machine: Listener on attacking machine: 11 | P", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Offensive Security - Penetration Test Report", "chunk_id": 2}}
