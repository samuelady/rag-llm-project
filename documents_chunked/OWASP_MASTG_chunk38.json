However, it’s important to remember that automatic tools have limitations and will only find what they have been programmed to find. Therefore, human analysis may be necessary to augment results from automatictools(intuitionisoftenkeytosecuritytesting). Threat Modeling is an important artifact: documents from the workshop usually greatly support the identification of muchoftheinformationasecuritytesterneeds(entrypoints,assets,vulnerabilities,severity,etc.).

Security Testing during the Software Development Life Cycle Software development is not very old, after all, so the end of developing without a framework is easy to observe. We haveallexperiencedtheneedforaminimalsetofrulestocontrolworkasthesourcecodegrows. In the past, “Waterfall” methodologies were the most widely adopted: development proceeded by steps that had a predefinedsequence.

Assoftwaredevelopmentmatured,competitionincreasedanddevelopersneededtoreacttomarketchangesmorequickly while creating software products with smaller budgets. The idea of less structure became popular, and smaller teams collaborated, breaking silos throughout the organization. The “Agile” concept was born (Scrum, XP, and RAD are well- knownexamplesofAgileimplementations);itenabledmoreautonomousteamstoworktogethermorequickly. Security wasn’t originally an integral part of software development. It was an afterthought, performed at the network levelbyoperationteamswhohadtocompensateforpoorsoftwaresecurity! Althoughunintegratedsecuritywaspossible when software programs were located inside a perimeter, the concept became obsolete as new kinds of software con- sumptionemergedwithweb,mobile,andIoTtechnologies.
