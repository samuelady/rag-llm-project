Moreover, such vulnerabilities could lead to other forms of attacks, including privilege escalation, allowing attackers to run system commands and move laterally to other systems in the internal network. 101\\nRecommendation We recommend ensuring that the Redis service is not publicly accessible. The Redis service should be safeguarded behind a firewall or made available only to users connected through a Virtual Private Network (VPN) server. However, if the Redis service is required to be directly accessible over the Internet, we recommend reconfiguring it such that it is accessible only from known IP addresses.

Version detected: 5.0.7 End-of-life date: 2022-04-27 Latest version for the cycle: 5.0.14 This release cycle (5.0) doesn't have long-term-support (LTS). The cycle was released on 2018-10-17 and its latest release date was 2021-10-04. The support ended on 2020-04-30. Risk description Using end-of-life (EOL) software poses significant security risks for organizations. EOL software no longer receives updates, including critical security patches. This creates a vulnerability landscape where known and potentially new security flaws remain unaddressed, making the software an attractive target for malicious actors. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, disrupt services, or steal sensitive data. Moreover, without updates, compatibility issues arise with newer technologies, leading to operational inefficiencies and increased potential for system failures. Additionally, regulatory and compliance risks accompany the use of EOL software. Many industries have strict data protection regulations that require up-to-date software to ensure the highest security standards. Non-compliance can result in hefty fines and legal consequences. Organizations also risk damaging their reputation if a breach occurs due to outdated software, eroding customer trust and potentially leading to a loss of business. Therefore, continuing to use EOL software undermines both security posture and business integrity, necessitating timely upgrades and proactive risk management strategies. 103\\nRecommendation To mitigate the risks associated with end-of-life (EOL) software, it's crucial to take proactive steps. Start by identifying any EOL software currently in use within your organization. Once identified, prioritize upgrading or replacing these applications with supported versions that receive regular updates and security patches. This not only helps close security gaps but also ensures better compatibility with newer technologies, enhancing overall system efficiency and reliability.Additionally, develop a comprehensive software lifecycle management plan. This plan should include regular audits to identify upcoming EOL dates and a schedule for timely updates or replacements. Train your IT staff and users about the importance of keeping software up to date and the risks associated with using outdated versions. By maintaining a proactive approach to software management, you can significantly reduce security risks, ensure compliance with industry regulations, and protect your organization's reputation and customer trust.
