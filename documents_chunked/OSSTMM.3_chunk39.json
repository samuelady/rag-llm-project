What an Analyst does with these is first and foremost a result of the legal regulations of the Analyst’s region and the region where the work is being performed. Disclosure Rights What you do have to do is make sure that your access to and use of the product or solution did not require any sort of provisions, Non-Disclosure contract, or End User License Agreement (EULA) that denies you the right to claim, announce, or distribute any vulnerabilities discovered. If it did and you or the client accepted this contract then you can’t disclose to anyone, perhaps even the manufacturer, without potential legal repercussions. Furthermore if you work for the company making that product or are a legal client of theirs then you may not be able to legally disclose anything either. Furthermore, your rights in any case may be challenged according to the process of law in your region rather than existing legal precedent. Responsibilities However, if those cases do not apply then you effectively own that vulnerability and the sooner you make it public the more rights you have as the owner. In many countries, processes and information can be protected by law and often the legal process requires publication or legally filing such with attribution. If your disclosure can do no PHYSICAL harm (like yelling fire in a crowded movie theater), it is yours to make and no legal posturing need shake you when you’re right. However, to be safest, you should also promote, with the disclosed vulnerability, the controls which one can apply to fix the problem. For example, if it’s a problem with how one authenticates with a solution then suggest an alternative authentication scheme and how it can be successfully integrated. You do not need to wait for the manufacturer to release a fix or a recall to let people fix the problem. However, should you choose to work within the context of notifying the manufacturer, you will need to give them ample time to address the problem before making it public. There is a valid argument that the vulnerability may already be known in criminal circles and need immediate attention. Therefore should you", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 39}}
