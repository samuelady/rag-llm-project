Downloaders What it is: Normal-looking programs designed to fetch and install malware without raising any security alarms. In effect, what downloaders allow attackers to do is to get a “man on the inside” prior to committing to a full attack (it’s no coincidence they’re typically called “trojan programs”). Once a downloader creeps its way onto a victim’s system it can scope out the security settings, then smuggle other dangerous malware in after it’s established the cost is clear. Even after an attack is discovered and the other malware has been removed, as long as the downloader is still there hiding away, it can grab more malware and start the process all over again. THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 1: SCOUTING REPORTS 6 What makes protection a challenge: Downloaders are one step removed from the actual dirty work involved in executing an attack. That means they don’t have to pack the same kind of functionality that might get other malware blocked. Instead, malware makers can focus solely on designing downloaders to be extremely good at avoiding detection. Think of it as attackers choosing to have a team made up skilled specialists rather than mediocre generalists. The downloader is a prolific passer and the malware it downloads is a sensational scorer. With both of them able to focus on their respective speciality, they’re able to be much more effective when paired together. Drive-by Downloads / Download Hijacking What it is: In nature, the big predators hang out at common water holes and wait for their prey to come by. On the Internet, the big predators find ways to turn popular website visits into covert attacks. In some cases, they inject code through comments that force unsuspecting visitors to automatically download malware. In other cases, they compromise the web server and inject malicious code into seemingly legitimate downloads. Another trick is to utilize exploit kits, programs designed to actively probe the website visitor’s system for software vulnerabilities that can be exploited. What makes protection a challenge: Not only do attackers have the element of surprise in these situations, they also have a collection of tricks to make sure they’re successful. If you update your browser, they’ll update their code. If you patch a vulnerability they’ll move on to a new one. It’s also not as if we’re talking about strictly sketchy websites. Some of the web’s most popular sites (The New York Times, the BBC, AOL, the MSN homepage) have been compromised in the past. You usually can’t ask employees to stop using the Internet altogether. Malvertising What it is: Marketers aren’t the only ones who like to utilize advertising to get in front of the crowds of website visitors. Criminals do the same thing, creating fake ads or inserting malicious code into legitimate ads so they can quite literally capture their audience.
