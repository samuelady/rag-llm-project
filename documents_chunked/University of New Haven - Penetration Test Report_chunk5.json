Security Logging and Monitoring Failures 5. Security Misconfiguration 10. Server-Side Request Forgery 3.4 PCI DSS Auditing One of the requests of AEC was for experience in PCI DSS from the RFP. Throughout the engagement, New Haven Hacking Inc. audited PCI DSS compliance in accordance with the proper Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ). By doing this, New Haven Hacking Inc. can ensure which PCI DSS security requirements are met in accordance with the proper SAQ for Page 7\\nthe type(s) of transactions being performed by AEC. Each PCI DSS compliance failure can be found in Section 2.3.1. 3.5 NIST SP 800-53 NIST SP 800-53 is the National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-53, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organization. NIST 800-53 is a security compliance standard that offers guidance for how organizations should select then maintain security and privacy controls for information systems. NIST 800-53 is mandatory for all federal agencies however, its guidelines can be adopted by any organization operating information systems with sensitive or regulated data. This standard providesacatalogofprivacyandsecuritycontrolsforprotectingagainstvariousthreats. Table 3 provides security and privacy control methodology which are organized into 20 fami- lies.

The vulnerabilities are categorized based on the risk level. The risk levels were calculated using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) [6]. Risk Level and Total Number of Discovered Vulnerabilities Severity Low Moderate High Critical (0.1-3.9) (4.0-6.9) (7.0-8.9) (9.0-10.0) Vulnerability Count 1 1 1 1 The following table breaks down the discovered vulnerabilities by overall risk score, impact, and exploitability. The scores were calculated using NIST’s CVSS v3.1 calculator [7].
