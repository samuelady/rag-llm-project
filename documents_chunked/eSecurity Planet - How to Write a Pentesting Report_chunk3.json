Instead of focusing on vulnerabilities, this section will focus on a system-by-system and test-by-test review of the penetration testing process. Ã— This section will discuss all attack methods attempted, including those that did not succeed. This expanded information will help reinforce the value of the parts of the security stack that performed well. https://www.esecurityplanet.com/networks/pentest-report/ 3/11\\nThis section can be very long as it will contain many details. It will typically be written as a draft or as notes early in the process and pen testers can put raw notes and screenshots here initially. If the section seems too long, some repetitive information for non-critical vulnerabilities can be moved to the appendix. For example, if a test was performed on all 1,500 endpoints in an organization and was blocked by the local firewall, it would be better to give this test a name and show that the endpoints passed the test. The details of how this test was performed can be moved to the Full Testing Procedure Details Appendix. Ratings & Risk Score Appendix When assigning priority to vulnerabilities, most penetration testing companies use a standardized method and score to determine a rating or risk score (numeric or qualitative). This section in the appendix should explain the system for the client and will usually be written in advance as a standardized section of all pen test reports. Vulnerability Details Appendix For each vulnerability found, the vulnerability can be explained in detail in this appendix. For example, most non-technical readers will not need to know the details of a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability and many technical teams already know what they are. A full explanation may not be needed and therefore not included in the main sections of the pentest. However, some might find more details helpful and thus an appendix can be considered. Since many vulnerabilities are standardized, this section can also be prepared in advance for the most common vulnerabilities expected in the pentest. Full Testing Procedure Details Appendix As noted above, some testing will be repetitive and if they do not result in any discovered vulnerabilities the tests may not be interesting. However, some technical teams and some compliance auditors will want to see the methodology performed for each test and would appreciate a detailed appendix section. Acronym Appendix Security and IT use an enormous number of acronyms for technologies, vulnerabilities, protocols, etc. This appendix should explain each acronym used in the report to help eliminate any confusion and misunderstanding. For electronic copies, the acronyms used elsewhere in the report could use internal document links directly to this appendix. 3 Factors For Effective Penetration Test Reports For a pentest report to be effective, the results must be useful and provide value to all levels of readers, from executives to hands-on technicians.
