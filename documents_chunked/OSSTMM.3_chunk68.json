Actual Security Delta The Actual Security Delta is useful for comparing products and solutions by previously estimating the change (delta) the product or solution would make in the scope. We can find the Actual Security Delta, ActSec, with the formula: ActSec  FC OpSec SecLim . base base base True Protection Can be used as a simplified expression for the optimal coverage of a given scope where 100 signifies an optimal relationship between the Porosity, True Controls and Security Limitations. True Protection is given as: TruPro100TC OpSec SecLim base base base Actual Security To measure the current state of operations with applied controls and discovered limitations, a final calculation is required to define Actual Security. As implied by its name this is the whole security value which combines the three values of operational security, controls, and limitations to show the actual state of security. Actual Security (total), ActSec, is the true state of security provided as a hash of all three sections. A rav of 100 signifies a perfect balance of security however the Actual Security is not a true percentage value. Scores above 100 are also possible which signifies that the tested scope has more controls implemented than necessary which could also be proof of overspending.

The general public answers no to this question. One security professional answered, “Yes but only if everyone else has to take it too.” Trust can be both a problem and a solution. It is a problem where it puts security in a compromising position. Like the concept of potential energy in physics, trust creates a concentration of authorization which can explode into a big problem should the trust fail or the trusted target be deceived into harming the trust-giver. However it can also reduce the need for continuous, possibly redundant re-authentication, increasing the efficiency of operations. For that reason, trust is often seen as an “authenticate once and walk away” protocol. This is most often seen in Human Security where Human Resources departments research a candidate before the hire and afterward that person has continuous access to resources until they are no longer an employee. Re-authentication is then done seldom or sporadically and rarely at the same", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 68}}
