THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 1: SCOUTING REPORTS 9 SQL Injection What it is: If a website has an input box or entry form (like when you’re entering in your username and password, or your credit card number if you’re buying something) then an attacker can try inserting structured query language code to gain access to or make changes to the stored data. What makes protection a challenge: SQL injection exploits a trust between the web application and its database to let the attacker do pretty much whatever it wants with the database. If all you can think of is “delete data” then you’re underestimating the depths a criminal can stoop to. Besides adding, removing, and changing data, and in addition to stealing info like client credit card numbers, personal data, and health records, there’s also the possibility of inserting malicious code to be passed back to users when they use the form, instead of the data they’re looking for. Once criminals start using that tactic they can abuse popular websites to do their dirty work for them like distributing drive-by downloads, building a botnet army, even hijacking DNS requests to send visitors to malicious versions of legitimate websites they know and trust. If the login form is vulnerable, SQL injection can even help with password cracking by the bypassing the login altogether. Any place where a user can input information into a website with a database, it has the potential to be SQL injectable, which unfortunately makes it a widespread problem. You can’t just remove all user-input interactions from your website and still get any purchases or feedback. THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPart 2: The Game Plan As anyone who’s ever been on the wrong side of a data breach can attest, security is not a game. First of all, the stakes are real. But also unlike a game, there are no set rules or boundaries. Even if there were, attackers aren’t exactly known for their fair play. That said, we do tend to discuss security using sports terms. There is an offense with attackers and there is defense. The goal of the defenders is to stop the attackers, to prevent them from accessing or causing damage to our assets. This is done through defensive tactics just like the attackers apply offensive tactics. The biggest problem is we don’t always know the parameters of the “game” we’re playing with attackers until it’s too late. We don’t know who our opponents are. We don’t know their capabilities or their goals. Is it stealthy, silent robbery or a quick smash and grab for data they can quickly encrypt and ransom? Are we their target of hate or are we a moment of opportunity for them? As a result, we’re pressured to develop tactics that can somehow be equally effective against a diverse and rapidly growing variety of potential attacks. Worse, our defenses also have to take into account the operational needs of the", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Playbook", "chunk_id": 5}}
