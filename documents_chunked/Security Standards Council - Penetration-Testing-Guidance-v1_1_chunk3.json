More specific risks scores associated with each vulnerability. that vulnerability may pose, including specific methods how and to what extent it may be For PCI DSS, external vulnerability scans must exploited. Examples of vulnerabilities include but be performed by an ASV and the risks ranked in are not limited to SQL injection, privilege accordance with the CVSS. Internal vulnerability escalation, cross-site scripting, or deprecated scans may be performed by qualified personnel protocols. (does not require an ASV) and risks ranked in accordance with the organization’s risk-ranking process as defined in PCI DSS Requirement 6.1. An external vulnerability scan is conducted from outside the target organization. An internal vulnerability scan is conducted from inside the target organization. Duration Relatively short amount of time, typically several Engagements may last days or weeks seconds to several minutes per scanned host. depending on the scope of the test and size of the environment to be tested. Tests may grow in time and complexity if efforts uncover additional scope. 2.2 Scope PCI DSS defines the cardholder data environment (CDE) as “the people, processes, and technology that store, process, or transmit cardholder data or sensitive authentication data.” The scope of a penetration test, as defined in PCI DSS Requirement 11.3, includes the entire CDE perimeter and any critical systems. This applies both to the external perimeter (public-facing attack surfaces) and the internal perimeter of the CDE (LAN-LAN attack surfaces). The scope of testing may include locations of cardholder data, applications that store, process, or transmit cardholder data, critical network connections, access points, and other targets appropriate for the complexity and size of the organization. This should include resources and assets utilized by personnel to maintain systems in the CDE or to access cardholder data, as the compromise of such assets could allow an attacker to obtain credentials with access to or a route into the CDE. All penetration testing should only be conducted as defined by the rules of engagement agreed upon by both parties.
