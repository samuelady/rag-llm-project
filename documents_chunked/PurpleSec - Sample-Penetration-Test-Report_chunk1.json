{"text": "susceptible to DoS via code over Schannel. A script can be written to exploit this vulnerability and cause the receiving system to open multiple threads and lockout the processor. This was not exploited as PurpleSec does not use DDOS in its testing. sales@purplesec.us 5\\nJANUARY 1, 2020 1.3 Overall Risk Rating Having considered the potential outcomes and the risk levels assessed for each documented testing activity, PurpleSec considers Example Institute’s overall risk exposure regarding malicious actors’ attempts to breach and/or control resources within their information environment to be EXTREME (as determined using PurpleSec Risk Matrix). Fig. 1-1: PurpleSec Risk Matrix 1.4 Prioritized Recommendations Based on the results achieved during the test project PurpleSec makes the following recommendations (presented by order of priority): • Patch critical systems (Microsoft Security Bulletin MS17-010 – Critical) • Run Vulnerability Scans on at least monthly basis (scan-patch-scan again) • Change passwords (10+ complex characters) on all systems that contain ePHI. • Social Engineering training for every employee. • Disable SMB and spoolsvc on McAfee server. sales@purplesec.us 6\\nJANUARY 1, 2020 2.0 Test Scope and Method 2.1 Extent of Testing Example Institute engaged PurpleSec to provide the following penetration testing services: • Network-level, technical penetration testing against hosts in the internal networks. • Network -level, technical penetration testing against internet facing hosts. • Social Engineering, phone phishing against CLIENT employees. • Social Engineering, email phishing against CLIENT employees. 2.2 Test Scope Summary The following information environment zones were included in the scope of the penetration test: • Internal Network: Example Institute’s general internal networks. The test was conducted in two phases: • Internal stage: Starting from the internal network zone. Intended to simulatethe network-level actions of a malicious actor who gained a foothold within the internal network zone.

Port and vulnerability scanning, as well as other reconnaissance activities revealed serious security holes. The most concerning vulnerabilities allow complete system takeover on important servers, most critically the McAfee Security server; compromise of which could allow a potential attacker to render the endpoint security for the entire internal network inoperable or ineffective. Once server compromise was achieved, directory traversal to search for important data was conducted. The analyst was able to identify many directories with private patient data and numerous other data that would fall under HIPAA and PCI compliance. 3.2 Actions Taken To determine and practically demonstrate the feasibility of expanding access given a foothold within the internal network, the ISA conducted the following activities: From Zone: Internal network Via: N/A To Zone: Internal network Method: Network-level penetration testing Current Zone Activities: The ISA used a SecureSensor deployed inside Example Institute’s facilities to conduct port, service, and vulnerability scanning as well as other reconnaissance techniques within Example Institute’s internal networks. Vulnerabilities were found and validated. SMB vulnerability ETERNALBLUE was exploited to gain root level access to multiple critical systems including the McAfee system security server.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "PurpleSec - Sample-Penetration-Test-Report", "chunk_id": 1}}
