The redis-cli command line tool and redis-sentinel service may be vulnerable to integer overflow when parsing specially crafted large multi- bulk network replies. This is a result of a vulnerability in the underlying hiredis library which does not perform an overflow check before calling the calloc() heap allocation function. This issue only impacts systems with heap allocators that do not perform their own overflow checks. Most modern systems do and are therefore not likely to be affected. Furthermore, by default redis-sentinel uses the jemalloc allocator which is also not vulnerable. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14. Exploit N/A Risk level High 76\\nCVSS 8.8 CVE CVE-2022-24834 Summary Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. A specially crafted Lua script executing in Redis can trigger a heap overflow in the cjson library, and result with heap corruption and potentially remote code execution. The problem exists in all versions of Redis with Lua scripting support, starting from 2.6, and affects only authenticated and authorized users. The problem is fixed in versions 7.0.12, 6.2.13, and 6.0.20. Exploit N/A Risk level Medium CVSS 6.8 CVE CVE-2022-24735 Summary Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk.
