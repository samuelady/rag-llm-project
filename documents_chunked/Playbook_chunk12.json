{"text": "simple as changing your web servers to respond to every request with a 200 even if it’s not found or moved (error codes 404 and 302, respectively) can render common, automated web scraping and analysis tools mostly useless. You can tune your TCP responses also so every port queried responds to every SYN with an ACK. This is often most easily done with a port-forwarding firewall responding for the server, whether a server exists for that IP address or not. That technique makes a TCP port scan worthless. Of course, this will not stop an advanced attacker with access to better tools, but that’s what your zone defense is for. Changing your defaults is how you make the pool of possibly successful attackers much smaller. 5. Know what normal looks like. The way you do that is by knowing and understanding your employees, your vendors, your routines, your operating hours, and your policies. For example, if you know that no Microsoft Security center should be calling you to allow them to remotely inspect your system for malicious activity because you never paid for such a service then you’ll recognize it as a social engineering or phishing attack and will be prepared to stop it quickly. THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 2: THE GAME PLAN 18 6. Make your users part of the solution. By making sure all your employees are aware of what’s normal, you can prevent a majority or fraud and phishing attacks. Employees who are aware of routines will notice quickly when a customer sends an email rather then calls. Changes in routine are a good indicator of possible attacks and employees are the first line of defense by reporting their suspicions. Making it routine for employees to escalate and document changes in processes can help create a forensic trail. Later, this can be correlated with patterns on your network. You should also get in the habit of proactively talking to employees and asking how things are running. Complaints such as a noisy hard drive, a slow system, or strange messages can then be immediately investigated. If you are prepared to perform quick recoveries, a system that is acting suspicious can be quickly wiped and reinstalled. THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPart 3: Looking Downfield Despite the sports analogy, let’s be clear, cybersecurity isn’t something you dabble in. There’s no bush league cybersecurity. It’s not a game. Losers are real victims who incur real and sometimes catastrophic losses. Even winning is just a fleeting moment that is gone as quickly as it came. Cybersecurity is hard because we don’t know all of the possible vulnerabilities we have or all of the possible threats there may be. Even if we could, they change too frequently for us to maintain specific defenses. That’s because the environment we work in is changing all the time. New technologies, new business models, new services, and new communication channels make it extremely difficult to secure it all. Furthermore, this competition against attackers will last indefinitely.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Playbook", "chunk_id": 12}}
