Exploit N/A Risk level Medium CVSS 5 CVE CVE-2020-21468 Summary A segmentation fault in the redis-server component of Redis 5.0.7 leads to a denial of service (DOS). NOTE: the vendor cannot reproduce this issue in a released version, such as 5.0.7 Exploit N/A Risk level Medium CVSS 4 CVE CVE-2021-32672 Summary Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. When using the Redis Lua Debugger, users can send malformed requests that cause the debuggerâ€™s protocol parser to read data 87\\nbeyond the actual buffer. This issue affects all versions of Redis with Lua debugging support (3.2 or newer). The problem is fixed in versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14. Exploit N/A Risk level Medium CVSS 4 CVE CVE-2020-14147 Summary An integer overflow in the getnum function in lua_struct.c in Redis before 6.0.3 allows context- dependent attackers with permission to run Lua code in a Redis session to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly bypass intended sandbox restrictions via a large number, which triggers a stack-based buffer overflow. NOTE: this issue exists because of a CVE-2015-8080 regression. Exploit N/A Risk level Low CVSS 3.6 CVE CVE-2023-45145 Summary Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. On startup, Redis begins listening on a Unix socket 88\\nbefore adjusting its permissions to the user-provided configuration. If a permissive umask(2) is used, this creates a race condition that enables, during a short period of time, another process to establish an otherwise unauthorized connection. This problem has existed since Redis 2.6.0-RC1. This issue has been addressed in Redis versions 7.2.2, 7.0.14 and 6.2.14. Users are advised to upgrade. For users unable to upgrade, it is possible to work around the problem by disabling Unix sockets, starting Redis with a restrictive umask, or storing the Unix socket file in a protected directory. Exploit N/A Risk level Low CVSS 2.1 CVE CVE-2022-24736 Summary Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. Prior to versions 6.2.7 and 7.0.0, an attacker attempting to load a specially crafted Lua script can cause NULL pointer dereference which will result with a crash of the redis-server process. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 7.0.0 and 6.2.7. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable, if Lua scripting is not being used, is to block access to `SCRIPT LOAD` and `EVAL` commands using ACL rules. Exploit N/A Risk level Low 89\\nCVSS 1.8 CVE CVE-2022-3647 Summary ** DISPUTED ** A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in Redis up to 6.2.7/7.0.5. Affected is the function sigsegvHandler of the file debug.c of the component Crash Report. The manipulation leads to denial of service. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. The real existence of this vulnerability is still doubted at the moment.
