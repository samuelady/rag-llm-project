{"text": "a characterization of the points of interaction, any possible indirect interactions, and all side effects from such interactions. This characterization must be then matched with the tests made to determine if all the correct tests were made. 3.5 Look for Signs of Intuition One thing that machines are clearly better than humans at is consistency. Humans generally get bored, confused, or careless. When a machine counts coins, it doesn’t lose count and need to start over. It doesn’t doubt itself and start over. It also won’t use intuition. Also called “gut instinct” the power of intuition is incredible. It allows people to imagine, apply creativity to a job, and know when something feels wrong. It’s part of the human condition to subconsciously detect problems and prepare accordingly. However it’s exactly this that sometimes leads us to make mistakes. This is never more obvious than when we count large amounts of similar-looking objects. Without total concentration, we may begin to feel uneasy about the tally and eventually we may feel compelled to either start over or just accept a particular correct-sounding number where we think we left off and continue from there. There is a time when a test requires precise concentration; during a large number of repetitive sequences. Generally, we tend to create tools to handle this type of repetition however it may not always be possible due to the dynamic nature of the test like when interacting with people instead of inanimate objects or machines. So as the test progresses, the tester may use intuition to make the presumption that the test will be unnecessary. The Analyst must pay special attention to these tests and look for signs of intuition in part of the tester. Signs of trouble from intuition in tests are: 1. Inconsistencies of types of tests performed across multiple, similar targets. 2. The number of tests decrease between targets. 3. The length of time for tests decrease between targets. 4. The same target tested more than once with the same tests. Detection of intuition in tests will show an inadequate testing process and the quality of the results should be regarded with suspicion. Re-testing may be necessary.

Since the tests will depend on the OpSec and controls of a particular channel and vector there will be unknowns. There may be a visible target which provides no interaction and no further information about that target can be determined from this vector and this channel. This is correct. The Analyst should report what has been found with certainty and not merely what could be. There is no place for guessing when measuring an attack surface. In addition to information about the test itself as to how it was made, the Analyst will need to report the following 7 test results: 1. Unknowns As more vectors and channels are analyzed, more information will be available and that which", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 47}}
