{"text": "not count for this control. In a COMSEC data networks audit, there may be multiple log files for non- repudiation. A port scan interacting at the IP Stack is recorded in one log while interaction with the web service is recorded to another log file. However, as the web service may not log the interactions from the POST method, the control is still counted; however, so is the security limitation.

A typical tool for Confidentiality is encryption. Additionally, obfuscation of 7 Confidentiality the content of an interaction is also a type of confidentiality, albeit a flawed one. In HUMSEC, however, a method of Confidentiality may include whispering or using hand signals. Count each instance for Access or Trust in the scope that provides the means to maintain the method of undisclosed interactions between the interacting parties. While “being private” is a common expression, the phrase is a bad example of privacy as a loss control because it includes elements of confidentiality. As a loss control, when something is done “in private” it means that only “the doing” is private but the content of the interaction may not be. A typical tool for Privacy is obscuring the interaction, that is, having the 8 Privacy interaction take place outside of the visibility of third parties. Confusion of the means of interaction as obfuscation is another method of applying the Privacy control. In HUMSEC, a method of Privacy may be simply taking the interaction into a closed room away from other people. In movies, we see techniques to create the Privacy control by setting two identical suitcases side by side, some type of incident to create confusion takes place, and the two people switch the suitcases in seemingly plain view. Count each instance for Access or Trust in the scope which can assure that the interaction process and Access to assets has finality and cannot be corrupted, stopped, continued, redirected, or reversed without it being known to the parties involved. Integrity is a change control process. In COMSEC data networks, encryption or a file hash can provide the Integrity control over the change of the file in transit. 9 Integrity In HUMSEC, segregation of duties and other corruption-reduction mechanisms provide Integrity control. Assuring integrity in personnel requires that two or more people are required for a single process to assure oversight of that process. This includes that no master Access to the whole process exists. There can be no person with full access and no master key to all doors.
