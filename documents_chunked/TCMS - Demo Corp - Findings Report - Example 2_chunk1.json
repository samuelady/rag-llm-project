Time-limited engagements do not allow for a full evaluation of all security controls. TCMS prioritized the assessment to identify the weakest security controls an attacker would exploit. TCMS recommends conducting similar assessments on an annual basis by internal or third-party assessors to ensure the continued success of the controls.

All testing performed is based on the NIST SP 800-115 Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment, OWASP Testing Guide (v4), and customized testing frameworks. Phases of penetration testing activities include the following: • Planning – Customer goals are gathered and rules of engagement obtained. • Discovery – Perform scanning and enumeration to identify potential vulnerabilities, weak areas, and exploits. • Attack – Confirm potential vulnerabilities through exploitation and perform additional discovery upon new access. • Reporting – Document all found vulnerabilities and exploits, failed attempts, and company strengths and weaknesses. Assessment Components Internal Penetration Test An internal penetration test emulates the role of an attacker from inside the network. An engineer will scan the network to identify potential host vulnerabilities and perform common and advanced internal network attacks, such as: LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning and other man- in-the-middle attacks, token impersonation, kerberoasting, pass-the-hash, golden ticket, and more. The engineer will seek to gain access to hosts through lateral movement, compromise domain user and admin accounts, and exfiltrate sensitive data.

CVSS V3 Severity Definition Score Range Exploitation is straightforward and usually results in system-level Critical 9.0-10.0 compromise. It is advised to form a plan of action and patch immediately. Exploitation is more difficult but could cause elevated privileges and High 7.0-8.9 potentially a loss of data or downtime. It is advised to form a plan of action and patch as soon as possible. Vulnerabilities exist but are not exploitable or require extra steps such Moderate 4.0-6.9 as social engineering. It is advised to form a plan of action and patch after high-priority issues have been resolved. Vulnerabilities are non-exploitable but would reduce an organization’s Low 0.1-3.9 attack surface. It is advised to form a plan of action and patch during the next maintenance window. No vulnerability exists. Additional information is provided regarding Informational N/A items noticed during testing, strong controls, and additional documentation.
