{"text": "recommended to satisfy this requirement by actively attempting to identify routes and paths from networks outside the CDE into the CDE. All segmentation methods need to be specifically tested. In very large networks, with numerous internal LAN segments, it may be infeasible for the penetration tester to conduct specific tests from every individual LAN segment. In this case, the testing needs to be planned to examine each type of segmentation methodology in use (i.e., firewall, VLAN ACL, etc.) in order to validate the effectiveness of the segmentation controls. The level of testing for each segmentation methodology should provide assurance that the methodology is effective in all instances of use. In order to effectively validate the segmentation methodologies, it is expected that the penetration tester has worked with the organization (or the organization’s QSA) to clearly understand all methodologies in use in order to provide complete coverage when testing. The penetration tester may choose to include systems located in these isolated LAN segments not directly related to the processing, transmission, or storage of cardholder data to ensure these systems could not impact the security of the CDE if compromised. See Section 4.2.3 for specific guidance on testing methodologies for validating segmentation controls. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

PCI DSS reconfirms testing by requiring industry accepted penetration-testing approaches (many of which include social engineering as part of their approach) and to have an approach to penetration testing that \"considers the threats and vulnerabilities experienced by merchants in the last 12 months.\" This may include social-engineering attacks as a method used for introducing malware into the environment. Social-engineering tests are an effective method of identifying risks associated with end users’ failure to follow documented policies and procedures. There is no blanket approach to social-engineering engagements. If an organization chooses to include social-engineering testing as part of its annual security review, the tests performed should be appropriate for the size and complexity of the organization and should consider the maturity of the organization’s security awareness program. These tests might include in-person, non- technological interactions such as persuading someone to hold open a door, remote interactions such as having someone provide or reset a password, or convincing the end user to open a vulnerable e-mail attachment or hyperlink. While PCI DSS does not require testing to include social-engineering techniques, an entity can incorporate it into its penetration testing methodology as an ongoing method to determine the effectiveness of the security awareness program. The frequency of social-engineering tests would be determined by the entity when establishing its security awareness program. End-user security awareness re-education might be sufficient remediation for users who fail a social-engineering test. The objective is that, over time, fewer and fewer employees are making poor decisions that could allow an attacker to compromise security.
