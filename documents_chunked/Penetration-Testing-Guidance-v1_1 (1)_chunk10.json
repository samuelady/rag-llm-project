Note: An organization may want to consider having a development-environment lab where penetration tests can be performed outside of the production environment and internal resources can train and increase their experience to help both their skills and potential certifications. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

This section provides guidance for these activities and is organized by the typical phases that occur during a penetration test: pre-engagement, engagement, and post-engagement. 4.1 Pre-Engagement Before the engagement or testing begins, it is recommended that all parties involved (the organization, the tester, and where applicable, the assessor) be informed of the types of testing (i.e., internal, external, application-layer or network-layer) to be performed, how testing will be performed, and what the testing will target. By coordinating these details first, issues where the CDE scope is defined improperly or other issues arise that would require a retest might be avoided. This information may be gathered by conducting a pre- engagement call or during an on-site pre-engagement meeting. 4.1.1 Scoping The organization being assessed is responsible for defining the CDE and any critical systems. It is recommended that the organization work with the tester and, where applicable, the assessor to verify that no components are overlooked and to determine whether any additional systems should be included in scope. The scope of the penetration test should be representative of all access points, critical systems, and segmentation methodologies for the CDE. 4.1.2 Documentation Whenever possible, detailed documentation of any components within the scope should be made available to the tester. Common examples of such documents are application-interface documentation and implementation guides. This information will ensure the tester understands how functionality should work and whether results received are expected for the given scenario. As a part of the scoping process, the organization should consider supplying the tester with the following documentation:  A network diagram depicting all network segments in scope for the test (Refer to PCI DSS Requirements 1.1.2 and 1.1.3.)  Cardholder data flow diagram  A list of all expected services and ports exposed at the CDE perimeter  Details of how authorized users access the CDE  A list of all network segments that have been isolated from the CDE to reduce scope The penetration tester will use this information during the assessment to identify unexpected attack vectors of the CDE in addition to known attack vectors, insufficient authentication controls, and to confirm the proper segmentation of out-of-scope environments.
