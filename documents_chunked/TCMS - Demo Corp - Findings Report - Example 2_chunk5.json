Demo Corp BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL Page 12 of 38\\nTechnical Findings Internal Penetration Test Findings Finding IPT-001: Insufficient LLMNR Configuration (Critical) Description: Demo Corp allows multicast name resolution on their end-user networks. TCMS captured 20 user account hashes by poisoning LLMNR traffic and cracked 2 with commodity cracking software. The cracked accounts were used to leverage further access that led to the compromise of the Domain Controller. Risk: Likelihood: High – This attack is effective in environments allowing multicast name resolution. Impact: Very High – LLMNR poisoning permits attackers to capture password hashes to either crack offline or relay in real-time and pivot laterally in the environment.
