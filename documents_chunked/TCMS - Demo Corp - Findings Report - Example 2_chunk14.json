{"text": "In addition to improving authentication, NLA also helps protect the remote computer from malicious users and software by completing user authentication before a full RDP connection is established. Risk: Likelihood: Low – An attacker can discover these vulnerabilities with basic tools. Impact: High – If exploited, an adversary gains code execution, leading to lateral movement across the network. System: Identified 118 machines, please see the below file for listing.

This is generally done on the 'Remote' tab of the 'System' settings on Windows.

Each step also provides remediation recommendations to help mitigate risk. Step Action Remediation 1 Poisoned LLMNR responses to obtain NetNTLMv2 Disable multicast name resolution hash of regular network user via GPO. 2 Cracked NTLM hash offline of domain Increase password complexity. administrator users ‘production’ and ‘[name Utilize multi- removed]’ factor. Implement a Privileged Account Management solution. Utilize a password filter. 3 Leveraged password of ‘production’ account to gain Limit local administrator privileges access to several machines within the network and enforce least privilege. 4 Dumped hashes on accessed machines to find Disable WDigest via GPO. cleartext password of ‘Bartender’ account via wdigest 5 Overly-permissive ‘Bartender’ account permitted Limit local administrator privileges access to a large amount of machines within the and enforce least privilege. network 6 Dumped hashes on accessed machines to find Disable WDigest via GPO. cleartext password of Domain Administrator account 7 Utilized discovered credentials to log into the domain controller. Remediation Review action and remediation steps. Additional Scans and Reports TCMS provides all clients with all report information gathered during testing. This includes Nessus files and full vulnerability scans in detailed formats. These reports contain raw vulnerability scans and additional vulnerabilities not exploited by TCM Security. The reports identify hygiene issues needing attention but are less likely to lead to a breach, i.e. defense-in-depth opportunities. For more information, please see the documents in your shared drive folder labeled “Additional Scans and Reports”.
