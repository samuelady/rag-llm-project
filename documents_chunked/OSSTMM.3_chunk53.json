Now in addition to counting cells and seeing how they work, the machine will also see with which other cells or under what conditions they interact and how well. In The ravs are like counting cells and classifying them by what they each operation of the cell’s duties the machine can do to determine how well the organism fits into an environment. determine what the cells limitations are. So if it was possible for the machine to also repair a problem in faulty cells directly, fortify the body by changing the process of the cells, or removing the unnecessary cells, we would be able to directly affect the health of the body as a whole with each change. Or perhaps we might change the environment that the body is exposed to instead of the cells to make more global changes. By subjecting the person to better nutrition, diet, or exercise we will also change the body on a cellular level. All this is possible by knowing how things work inside the body and what’s there in these operations. Unfortunately there is no such machine for counting all cells in a human body. However it does exist for security. Analysts can count and verify the operations of targets in a scope as if it is a super-organism. They record its interactions and the controls surrounding those interactions. They classify them by operation, resources, processes, and limitations. Those numbers the Analysts generate are combined so that controls add to operational security and limitations take away from it. Even the value of the limitations, how badly each type of problem hurts, is also not arbitrary because it’s based on the combination of security and controls within that particular scope. So a bad problem in a protective environment will provide less over-all exposure than one in a less controlled environment.

In that equation, risk is the result of an informed, however highly biased, equation. If we can remove most of the bias by knowing the level of protection and therefore the level of vulnerability impact, we can reduce the bias in that equation and give a much better risk assessment. Therefore, the rav is actually the factual foundation for a risk assessment where an Analyst has facts to work with. The real power of the rav however is how it can provide answers to the following eight fundamental security questions with great accuracy. 1. How much money should be spent on security? The rav will show the current amount of protection to make security projections and define milestones even before buying a particular solution or implementing some new process. From these projections and milestones, financial restrictions can be created", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 53}}
