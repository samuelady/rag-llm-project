Not everyone behaves as trained. Therefore the truth of configuration and training is in the resulting operations. That’s why we need to test operations. The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual strives to be the ultimate security guide. Better known to security experts and hackers alike as the OSSTMM, spoken like “awesome” but with a “t”, is a formal methodology for breaking any security and attacking anything the most thorough way possible. Released for free for the first time in 2001 as the underdog to the security industry’s product- focused security advice, the manual achieved an instant following. Being open to anyone for peer review and further research led to it growing from its initial 12 page release to its current size of over 200 pages. For testing security operations and devising tactics it has no equal. The OSSTMM is in its third version and is a complete re-write of the original methodology. It now includes the ever-elusive security and trust metrics at its foundation. It required 7 years of research and development to produce the perfect operational security metric, an algorithm which computes the Attack Surface of anything. In essence, it is a numerical scale to show how unprotected and exposed something currently is. Security professionals, military tacticians, and security researchers know that without knowing how exposed a target is, it’s just not possible to say how likely a threat will cause damage and how much. But to know this requires a thorough security test which happens to be exactly what the OSSTMM provides. To say the OSSTMM 3 is a very thorough methodology is an understatement. It covers proper attack procedures, error handling, rules of engagement, proper analysis, critical security thinking, and trust metrics. It provides 17 modules like Visibility Audit, Trust Verification, Property Validation, and Competitive Intelligence Scouting, each which describes multiple attacks (called Tasks), for 5 different interaction types with a target (called Channels) organized by technical knowledge and equipment requirements as Human, Physical, Telecommunications, Data Networks, and Wireless. The OSSTMM has indeed become a complex organism but with a new focus on readability and usability, it is far from complicated to use. Security doesn’t have to last forever; just longer than everything else that might notice it’s gone.
