This authorizes the tester to test the environment and ensure the organization understands what to expect from the penetration test. Below are some examples of considerations that may be included in the rules of engagement:  During what time window will testing need to be performed?  Are there any legacy systems that have known issues with automated scanning? If so, how should testing be performed against these systems?  Is there a preferred method of communicating about scope and issues encountered during the engagement?  Does the entity want updates regarding ongoing exploitation of systems during the test? If so, the entity will need to determine whether they will or will not act upon such information or make changes to the environment. The entity may also want to implement its incident response plan in response to an exploit.  Are there security controls that would detect or prevent testing? Consider whether these should be disabled or configured to not interfere during testing. (See Section 4.1.7 for further guidance.)  If passwords or other sensitive data are compromised during the testing, does the tester need to disclose a list of all passwords and/or sensitive data accessed?  If equipment owned by the tester is to be connected to the organization’s network, what steps must be taken to ensure the equipment does not pose a threat to the environment (updated to the latest operating system, applied service packs and/or patches, etc.)?  Does the tester need to provide all IP addresses from which testing will originate?  Will sensitive data shown to be accessible during the test be retained by the tester during and after the penetration test? Only a proof-of-concept test should be performed, any cardholder data obtained must be secured in accordance with PCI DSS. (See Section 4.2.4 for more guidance.)  What steps will be taken if the tester detects a previous or active compromise to systems being tested? (For example, activate incident response procedures and stop penetration test until resolution of the compromise situation.) The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

The scope may include any systems managed, built, or", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Penetration-Testing-Guidance-v1_1 (1)", "chunk_id": 11}}
