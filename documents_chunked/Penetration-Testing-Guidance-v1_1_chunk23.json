{"text": "by the Client with the latest ASV report to ensure they agreed on the assets and targets under examination. Any differences in scope were noted and investigated. The penetration tester then gathered information on the target organization through web sites and mail servers, public records, and databases. This open-source intelligence (OSINT) gathering is an important next step in confirming scope and determining that all the appropriate assets have been included in the test. Newly discovered assets were vetted by the Client to determine whether they should be included in the penetration test. During this phase of the assessment, an additional disaster recovery site was identified in DNS, and Client confirmed this to be a warm backup in the event of failure of the primary sites. All relevant assets were added to the scope. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 28\\nOnce the assets were confirmed, the penetration tester enumerated the publicly available services provided by the targets. The tester actively tried to obtain usernames, network-share information, and application- version information of all running services and applications. In this phase, the penetration tester began to spider and map the applications, with and without credentials, in preparation for the exploitation phase. The tester was provided with the ability to complete a full transaction all the way through checkout and order confirmation. With target enumeration complete, the tester performed vulnerability mapping of identified services using automated tools and by comparing the port and service fingerprint against well-known vulnerability databases. This produced a list of unconfirmed vulnerabilities that were further examined in the exploitation phase of testing. The exploitation phase included tests and techniques designed to meet the objectives of the test. (These must be exploitive and may also be used to confirm the effectiveness of ancillary security controls such as intrusion detection systems or web application firewalls.) It was during this step that testing of the applications for issues related to the OWASP Top 10 and other web application frameworks took place. The final phase of testing included post-exploitation techniques. The term “post-exploitation” refers to the actions taken after the initial compromise of a system or device. It often describes the methodical approach of using privilege escalation techniques to gain additional access to systems or network resources. The extent to which post-exploitation techniques were performed were defined prior to the start of test to prevent the tester from putting production systems at risk of destabilization. Main vulnerabilities identified were: High:  Apache Tomcat Manager Application Deployer Authenticated Code Execution  Cross-site scripting (reflective)  Directory traversal Medium:  Deprecated protocols - SSLv2, SSLv3  SSL weak ciphers  Internal IP address disclosure Low:  IPS not enabled for disaster-recovery site  Slow HTTP denial-of-service attack Post-Engagement (Post-Execution Phase) At the completion of this examination, the penetration tester met with the Client to describe the preliminary results of the test and address any immediate concerns in advance of the report. The post-execution phase focused on analyzing", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Penetration-Testing-Guidance-v1_1", "chunk_id": 23}}
