Tests of targets which have obviously not been secured. 3.4 Characterize the Results The scientific method is not a checklist. It is a process which allows for intelligence and imagination. A hypothesis is made and then data is collected through testing and observation to evaluate that hypothesis. In a security test, a hypothesis is essentially made whenever a verification is made against a direct or indirect interactive point in the scope. The Analyst has the empirical data from those tests and must consider if the tests actually verified the hypothesis. Were the right tests made? Were enough tests made? Were the right channels or vectors tested? Were new interactions created that were also then tested? To do this, we characterize the results. To characterize a security test using the scientific method is to discover the properties of the scope to assure the correct tests were made for it. The tester makes a hypothesis as to the interactivity of a point in the attack surface. The test will return that the point is interactive and adds to the attack surface or not interactive and whether it still adds to the attack surface, controls in place, any limitations in those controls, any limitations in the defined security, and any anomalies. At this point the Analyst may be wrong about the function of the process in operation however the Analyst may not be wrong in which tests should be used to verify what the function actually is. This is why both knowledge of the process and creatively imagining the indirect interaction are necessary. For example, the Analyst may characterize a process as including the interaction between a visitor and the network via the access card. So while this visitor does not have the credentials to access the network, because the card reader is tied into the computer system, that visitor does access the network by swiping the card. The Analyst must consider how to test what happens when the visitor interacts with the card reader to gain access as well as the side effects of having the card read. However, even if the tests show that the card reader is connected to a stand-alone computer system and is not attached to the network, Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution-Non-Commercial-NoDerivs 2010, ISECOM, www.isecom.org, www.osstmm.org 57\\nthe Analyst has properly verified that the right tests were made against the right targets to get that answer. Therefore, the Analyst will examine the scope for where an interaction might occur as well as where operations show interactions do occur. This will allow a characterization of the points of interaction, any possible indirect interactions, and all side effects from such interactions. This characterization must be then matched with the tests made to determine if all the correct tests were made. 3.5 Look for Signs of Intuition One thing that machines are clearly better", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 46}}
