{"text": "function sigsegvHandler of the file debug.c of the component Crash Report. The manipulation leads to denial of service. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. The real existence of this vulnerability is still doubted at the moment. Upgrading to version 6.2.8 and 7.0.6 is able to address this issue. The patch is identified as 0bf90d944313919eb8e63d3588bf63a367f020a3. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB- 211962 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability. NOTE: The vendor claims that this is not a DoS because it applies to the crash logging mechanism which is triggered after a crash has occurred. Exploit N/A Vulnerability description Vulnerabilities found for Redis Key-Value Store 5.0.7 Risk description These vulnerabilities expose the affected applications to the risk of unauthorized access to confidential data and possibly to denial of service attacks. An attacker could search for an appropriate exploit (or create one) for any of these vulnerabilities and use it to attack the system. Notes: - The vulnerabilities are identified based on the server's version. - Only the first 30 vulnerabilities with the highest risk are shown for each port. 90\\nRecommendation We recommend you to upgrade the affected software to the latest version in order to eliminate the risks imposed by these vulnerabilities.

The root cause of this vulnerability is an insecure deserialization via T3, IIOP protocol that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to take control of the server. The attacker can send a crafted JNDI/RMI malicious object in order to achieve access to the server. We have detected this vulnerability by sending a crafted RMI object to the server with whoami payload and fetching the server response that was sent to one of our loggers. We send the response to a logger because this is an Out-of-Band vulnerability, meaning that the output of the command is not reflected in the response. Risk description The risk exists that a remote unauthenticated attacker can fully compromise the server in order to steal confidential information, install ransomware, or pivot to the internal network. Recommendation We recommend upgrading the Oracle WebLogic to a version higher than 12.2.1.4.0 or 14.1.1.0.0 , which can be done from the administrator panel. 92\\nReferences https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-21839 https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2023.html Classification Category ID / Value CVSS 7 CVE CVE-2023-21839 Verification ✔ This finding was validated so it is not a False Positive. 93\\n4.2.6 Oracle Fusion", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Sample-Pentest-Engagement-Report-group-by-target", "chunk_id": 22}}
