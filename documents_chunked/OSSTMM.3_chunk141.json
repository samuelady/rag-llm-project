If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of Patent infringement, Trade Secret law infringement, or for any other legal reason, where conditions are imposed on any person (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse said person from the conditions of this License. If said person cannot satisfy simultaneously the obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence said person may not use, copy, apply, use, distribute, or promote, the Methodology at all. If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. 9. If the distribution or use of the Methodology is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by Trade Secret interfaces, the original creator who places the Methodology under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that application, use, or distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 10. ISECOM may publish revised or new versions of the Open Methodology License. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. NO WARRANTY 11. Because the methodology is licensed free of charge, there is no warranty for the methodology, to the extent permitted by applicable law except when otherwise stated in writing the creator or other parties provide the methodology “as is” without a warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance in use of the methodology is with the persons accepting this license. Should the methodology prove incomplete or incompatible said person assumes the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction. 12. In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will the creator, or any other party who may use, apply, or teach the methodology unmodified as permitted herein, be liable to any persons for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use of or inability to use the methodology (including but not limited to loss, inaccuracies, or failure of the methodology to operate with any other methodologies), even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
