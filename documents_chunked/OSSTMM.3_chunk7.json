This also makes it a perfectly suited for testing cloud computing, virtual infrastructures, messaging middleware, mobile communication infrastructures, high-security locations, human resources, trusted computing, and any logical processes which all cover multiple channels and require a different kind of security test. A set of attack surface metrics, called ravs, provide a powerful and highly flexible tool that can provide a graphical representation of state, and show changes in state over time. This integrates well with a ’dashboard’ for management and is beneficial for both internal and external testing, allowing a comparison/combination of the two. Quantitative risk management can be done from the OSSTMM Audit report findings, providing a much improved result due to more accurate, error free results however you will find the proposed trust management here to be superior to risk management. The OSSTMM includes information for project planning, quantifying results, and the rules of engagement for performing security audits. The methodology can be easily integrated with existing laws and policies to assure a thorough security audit through all channels. Legal and industry specific regulations also commonly require a security audit as a component of becoming compliant. An OSSTMM audit is well suited for most all of these cases. Specific OSSTMM tests can therefore be connected with particular security standard requirements, making the OSSTMM itself a way to gain compliance to those requirements. This applies to regulations and policies from physical security like the US Federal Energy Reserve Commission’s ruling to pure data security efforts such as the latest PCI-DSS and including cross-channel requirements as found in many NIST recommendations and information security management specifications like ISO/IEC 27001:2005, ISO/IEC 27002:2005, and ISO/IEC 27005:2008. It is recommended that you read through the OSSTMM once completely before putting it into practice. It aims to be a straight-forward tool for the implementation and documentation of a security test.

Some of the words used in this document may stray from the definition you are familiar with. New research often requires updating, enhancing, or retracting information from the world as we thought we have known it. This is a normal occurrence and to assist you with the changes, this document does try to define these words properly in their new context. In this document, an OSSTMM audit or “audit” is the result of the analysis performed after an OSSTMM test. The person who performs this function of test and analysis is referred to as the Security Analyst or just “Analyst”.
