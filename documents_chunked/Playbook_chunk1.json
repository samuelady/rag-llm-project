{"text": "What it is: There are two ways to steal anything — you either take it yourself or you get someone else to give it to you. Social engineering is a broad umbrella term for any tactics designed to exploit and manipulate trust, so the victim hands the attacker what they want — access to information, accounts, or computers inside a secured area. Think fake customer service calls designed to reset passwords or a criminal spoofing your CEO’s email address and asking someone in finance to send an urgent wire transfer — a type of scam referred to as a business email compromise (BEC). What makes protection a challenge: Everyone — repeat, everyone — can be conned, defrauded, fooled, or manipulated. Being vulnerable can sometimes come down to a lack of training or experience, but more often it can simply come down to distraction and mental fatigue. Since this attack targets people directly there’s very little that technical safeguards can do, especially if the action isn’t outside the employee’s typical responsibilities or usual behavior — like resetting a password for a desperate user (a typical tech support con). THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 1: SCOUTING REPORTS 5 Ransomware What it is: Malicious software designed to encrypt a victim’s files and then demand payment, generally in anonymous Bitcoin, in exchange for decrypting the files. As with other malware infections, ransomware attacks typically start with employees falling victim to phishing emails or visiting compromised websites. Unlike other malware infections, however, the primary goal of ransomware isn’t to gain stealth and persistence for long periods of time. Instead, its priority is to spread as quickly as possible, encrypt as much data as possible, then actively alert victims of its presence so criminals can extort them. What makes protection a challenge: Ransomware will lock up any drive the employee has access to, including connected USB drives and network shares. Once files are encrypted the only way to regain access to them is to a) hope you have a reliable, up-to-date backup; b) hope a security researcher has cracked the encryption and made a decrypting tool available; or c) hold your nose and pay the ransom. Paying up is anything but a sure thing, because, well, ransomware authors are criminals. Being dishonest is what they do. They’re also occasionally less than spectacular at coding, so there’s also the risk of paying the ransom only to find your files were accidentally destroyed or rendered unrecoverable. One reason ransomware is hard to protect against is because it’s built to turn a strength — making files accessible across an organization — into a weakness. Additionally, with ransomware developing into a billion-dollar industry, there’s plenty of incentive for criminals to continue investing in delivery and evasion tactics to keep their business model humming. That means they can change faster than your signature-based security solutions can keep up.
