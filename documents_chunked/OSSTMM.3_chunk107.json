Such property or personal effects should remain personal and private unless it specifically involves the scope owner through disparagement, false light, competitiveness, or reasons stated in personnel contract agreements. Analysts must make efforts to not invade upon a person’s private life where that private life has made efforts to separate itself from the scope. Analysts with a special agreement to test systems which are under direct contract but not owned, or are owned but not housed on the owner’s legal property, must take great caution to assure tests have minimum impact on other systems outside the scope or contract.

In most cases, a target may also have contracts with providers and other third parties which may need to be reviewed and documented. This review forms a matrix against which testing should be mapped but not constrained, due to the ubiquity of the channel endpoints. Therefore it is important to consider, as some legislation requires, the target market or end users of this channel which must also be added to the scope for this module. 10.1.1 Policy (a) Review and document appropriate organizational policy regarding security, integrity, and privacy requirements of the scope. Verify the limitations on telecommunications imposed by the security policy. (b) Review and document contracts and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with service providers and other involved third parties. 10.1.2 Legislation Review and document appropriate regional and national legislation regarding the security and privacy requirements of the organization in the scope as well as that which includes the appropriate customers, partners, organizational branches, or resellers outside the scope. Where applicable, pay special attention to privacy and data retention of Call Detail Records, laws and rulings governing interception or monitoring of telecommunications, and provision of critical services such as E-911. 10.1.3 Culture Review and document appropriate organizational culture in the scope towards security and privacy awareness, required and available personnel training, organizational hierarchy, help desk use, and requirements for reporting security issues. 10.1.4 Age Review and document the age of systems, software, and service applications required for operations.
