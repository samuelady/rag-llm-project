{"text": "small scope we know as “our little world”. We apply them everywhere because they make life easier. But when we take them with us and try to adhere them to larger, different, more complicated series and types of interactions, we will likely make mistakes. What may make perfect sense to us based on our experiences may not make any sense at all outside of “our little world”. So what we need is a better, less biased way of looking at the bigger, more dynamic, less personal, world beyond ourselves. Furthermore, our little world is something we take around with us. When we are outside, our little world is outside with us. We interact in the space on the assumptions and prejudices we know and carry. When we go inside, we take our little world inside with us. This means we bring our ways of doing things and new interactions into a new environment. And it has always been this way. There is no perimeter. There is no us and them. It is each individual interacting and interconnecting with everyone and everything; each individual with their own little world of issues and preconceptions impacting on the rest, while at the same time being impacted by others. This means we need a way to see more than just the bigger world; we also need a way to see into each individual’s own little worlds too. Often the difficulty in creating security is blamed on the sophistication and the persistence of the attacks. However that only serves to shift the blame, but not solve the problem. The real challenge is in protecting particular interactions in an interconnected world filled with uncontrollable elements. Taken at face value, the sheer number of interactions may be daunting. Protection solutions often address this challenge by broadly addressing particular types of interactions or by monitoring all interactions as they occur for malicious intent. Unfortunately, broad security programs and processes cannot address enough of the elements as to provide significant protection. This leads security in practice to be more of an art depending on the practitioner to apply their own little world to the challenge of security. This can only add more complexity and new problems. The means to finding global, persistent protection in perfect balance with operations is through the Möbius Defense.

A Möbius Strip is a shape with no inside or outside which means there is no “side” to defend from. Therefore, what is needed is a defense designed to protect an environment where in each individual can be interacting and interconnecting with everyone and everything. The Möbius Defense does this in three steps: 1. Improving verification and analysis: verify and analyze operations for interactions and controls and not just", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 136}}
