{"text": "because it shows so well how we misunderstand controls that are so common around us. Ask anyone who has had to break open a locked door where they kick or hit the door to open it? That answer differs whether it is a key lock opened from the outside as opposed to a bolt lock on the inside. There’s a reason for this. When a lock (which is considered the authentication control) is added to a door, the heavy, solid door needs to have a space hollowed out and the lock inserted. That creates a limitation, a weak spot in the door. So does adding a handle. Doors with no handles or internal locks do not have this limitation. However they require the door to be opened from the inside in another means. So to open a door with that kind of lock, you kick or hit the door at the handle or lock mechanism. If there is a bolt lock, that limitation does not exist because the door remains solid. Those doors often require a force to open that will sooner break the door than the lock. Doors made to withstand high pressures have the bolts on the outside and the opening mechanism in the center of the door as a small hole, like doors on a boat or submarine, to avoid the weaknesses of hollowing out part of the door. Now to more directly answer the question: if it is better to have a weak lock than no lock. This question refers to a door with the minimum, a cheap or simple key lock (authentication) that can be bypassed by someone who wants to enter. So if we know the authentication is weak, then we know somebody can get in and even worse, they can do it without damaging the lock or the door which means we may have no knowledge of the intrusion. If you think, well, that’s okay because our problem isn’t the real crooks, it’s the opportunists looking for the low- hanging fruit then you’re making a risk decision and that does not affect your attack surface which is made from what you have and not what you want. Furthermore, by having a lock at all implies, most of all to the opportunists, that there is something of value inside. If you add a control, any control, you increase the attack surface of anything. If that new thing you add brings a new attack vector then you were probably better off without. In some cases, the new attack vector is smaller than the actual amount of safety the new control gives you. However, a good control will have no limitations and can shrink the attack surface. A lock in a door should not be easily subverted or add to the attack surface in a significant way. Such a lock requires force to open and that adds another control then which the lock provides, alarm. A broken lock is also a good notification of a break-in.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 18}}
