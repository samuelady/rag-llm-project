{"text": "Exam penetration test report should contain all the steps taken to successfully compromise machines both in the exam and lab environments. Accompanying data used in both environments should also be included, such as PoCs, custom exploit code, and so on. Please note that this report will be graded from a standpoint of correctness and completeness. The purpose of this report is to ensure that the student has a full understanding of penetration testing methodologies as well as the technical knowledge required to successfully achieve the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certification. 1.2 Objective The objective of this assessment is to perform an internal penetration test against the Offensive Security Lab and Exam network. The student is tasked with following methodical approach in obtaining access to the objective goals. This test should simulate an actual penetration test and how you would start from beginning to end, including the overall report. A sample page has been included in this document that should help you determine what is expected of you from a reporting standpoint. Please use the sample report as a guide to get you through the reporting requirement of the course. 1.3 Requirements The student will be required to complete this penetration testing report in its entirety and to include the following sections: • Overall High-Level Summary and Recommendations (Non-technical) • Methodology walk-through and detailed outline of steps taken • Each finding with accompanying screenshots, walk-throughs, sample code, and proof.txt file if applicable. • Any additional items as deemed necessary 4 | P a g e\\n2.0 Report – High-Level Summary OS-XXXXX was tasked with performing an internal penetration test in the Offensive Security Labs and Exam network. An internal penetration test is a simulated attack against internally connected systems. The focus of this test is to perform attacks, similar to those of a malicious entity, and attempt to infiltrate Offensive Security’s internal lab systems – the THINC.local domain, and the exam network. OS- XXXXX’s overall objective was to evaluate the network, identify systems, and exploit flaws while reporting the findings back to Offensive Security. While conducting the internal penetration test, there were several alarming vulnerabilities that were identified within Offensive Security’s network. For example, OS-XXXXX was able to gain access to multiple machines, primarily due to outdated patches and poor security configurations. During testing, OS-XXXXX had administrative level access to multiple systems. All systems were successfully exploited and access granted. These systems as well as a brief description on how access was obtained are listed below: • Target #1 – Obtained a low-privilege shell via the vulnerable web application called 'KikChat'. Once in, access was leveraged to escalate to 'root' using the 'getsystem' command in Meterpreter. 2.1 Report - Recommendations OS-XXXXX recommends patching the vulnerabilities identified during the penetration test to ensure that an attacker cannot exploit these systems in the future. One thing to remember is that these systems require frequent patching and once patched, should remain on a regular patch program in order to mitigate additional vulnerabilities that may", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Offensive Security - Penetration Test Report", "chunk_id": 1}}
