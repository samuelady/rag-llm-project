{"text": "by the entity when establishing its security awareness program. End-user security awareness re-education might be sufficient remediation for users who fail a social-engineering test. The objective is that, over time, fewer and fewer employees are making poor decisions that could allow an attacker to compromise security. Additional guidance on establishing an effective and robust security awareness program can be found in the Document Library on the PCI SSC website. Social-engineering testing may not be appropriate or provide a meaningful result for all organizations. Although social-engineering testing is not a requirement of PCI DSS, an organization may consider documenting the reason(s) for foregoing social-engineering testing and include applicable documentation with the internal and external penetration test reports, particularly if social-engineering attacks were encountered in the last 12 months. 2.6 What is considered a “significant change”? Per PCI DSS Requirements 11.3.1 and 11.3.2, penetration testing must be performed at least annually and after any significant change—for example, infrastructure or application upgrade or modification—or new system component installations. What is deemed “significant” is highly dependent an entity’s risk- assessment process and on the configuration of a given environment. Because of this variability, a significant change is not prescribed by PCI DSS. If the change could impact the security of the network or allow access to cardholder data, it may be considered significant by the entity. Penetration testing of significant changes is performed to ensure that controls assumed to be in place are still working effectively after the upgrade or modification. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 11\\n3 Qualifications of a Penetration Tester Qualified internal resources or a qualified third party may perform the penetration test as long as they are organizationally independent. This means the penetration tester must be organizationally separate from the management of the target systems. For example, in situations where a third-party company is performing the PCI DSS assessment for the entity, that party cannot perform the penetration test if they were involved in the installation, maintenance, or support of target systems. The following guidelines may be useful when selecting a penetration tester (or team) to understand their qualifications to perform penetration testing. 3.1 Certifications Certifications held by a penetration tester may be an indication of the skill level and competence of a potential penetration tester or company. While these are not required certifications, they can indicate a common body of knowledge held by the candidate. The following are some examples of common penetration testing certifications:  Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)  Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)  Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC) Certifications (e.g., GIAC Certified Penetration Tester (GPEN), GIAC Web Application Penetration Tester (GWAPT), or GIAC Exploit Researcher and Advanced Penetration Tester (GXPN))  CREST Penetration Testing Certifications  Communication Electronic Security Group (CESG) IT Health Check Service (CHECK) certification Note: The PCI SSC does not validate or endorse these certifications. 3.2 Past Experience Appropriate penetration testing experience and qualifications cannot be met by certifications alone.
