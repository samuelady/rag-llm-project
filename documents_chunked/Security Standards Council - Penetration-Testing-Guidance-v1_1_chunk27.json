Main vulnerabilities identified were:  Man in the middle – It was possible to perform a man-in-the-middle attack using ARP poisoning but the tester was not able to extract any sensitive information that could provide information on how to gain access to ODIN or THOR.  Weak password policy implemented – Weak password settings on local servers on the BALDER network were used to compromise accounts on this network. The tester was not able to use these accounts to gain access to ODIN or THOR. As these servers are not in PCI scope, the weak password policy was not considered to have an impact on compliance.  Old user accounts were compromised – The tester was able to compromise user accounts that were created but had never been in use on the BALDER network. The compromised accounts did not grant access to ODIN or THOR.  Others – Other vulnerabilities were noted as zone transfer, outdated software, unencrypted protocols used; these vulnerabilities were all related to LOKE or BALDER network and did not grant access to ODIN or THOR even when exploited. Post-Engagement (Post-Execution phase) The post-execution phase focused on analyzing the identified vulnerabilities to determine root causes, establish recommendations and/or remediation activities, and develop a final report where all vulnerabilities noted during the test were documented even though they did not have an impact on the cardholder data environment. The penetration test report was presented to the Client and it was discussed how the Client could remediate the vulnerabilities noted during the penetration test. It was confirmed that none of the vulnerabilities had an effect on the cardholder data environment. As no significant vulnerabilities related to the CDE environment were discovered and access to the CDE environment was not obtained, remediation testing was not performed. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

Cardholder data is collected as a card-present transaction by swiping or keying the card into a POS terminal.
