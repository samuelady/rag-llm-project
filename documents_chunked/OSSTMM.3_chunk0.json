{"text": "\\nDesigned for e-book readers or double-sided printing.\\nThis manual provides test cases that result in verified facts. These facts provide actionable information that can measurably improve your operational security. By using the OSSTMM you no longer have to rely on general best practices, anecdotal evidence, or superstitions because you will have verified information specific to your needs on which to base your security decisions.

Those who want to jump right into testing while using it may find the following quick-start information helpful. Quick Start To start making an OSSTMM test you will need to track what you test (the targets), how you test them (the parts of the targets tested and not the tools or techniques used), the types of controls discovered, and what you did not test (targets and parts of the targets). Then you may conduct the test as you are accustomed to with the objective of being able to answer the questions in the Security Test Audit Report (STAR) available at the end of this manual or as its own document. The STAR gives the specific test information on the state of the scope for the benefits of having a clear statement of the security metrics and details for comparisons with previous security tests or industry test averages. More details on the required information for the STAR is available throughout this manual and can be referenced as needed. As you may see, taking this approach means that very little time is required in addition to a standard test and the formalization of the report. It has been reported that this methodology actually reduces testing and reporting time due to the efficiencies introduced into the process. There should be no time or financial reason to avoid using the OSSTMM and no unreasonable restrictions are made to the tester. Upgrading from Older Versions If you are familiar with the OSSTMM 2.x series then you will find that the methodology has completely changed. The new rav provides a factual attack surface metric that is much more accurate for measuring the susceptibility to attacks. There are many other changes and enhancements as well but the primary focus has been to move away from solution-based testing which assumes specific security solutions will be found in a scope and are required for security (like a firewall). Another change you may notice is that there is now a single security testing methodology for all channels: Human, Physical, Wireless, Telecommunications, and Data Networks. The rav information from 2.x to 3.0 is incompatible. Those with early 3.0 draft rav (prior to RC 12) will require that the values be re-calculated using this final attack surface calculation which is available as a spreadsheet calculator at http://www.isecom.org/ravs. Previous OSSTMM security metrics measured risk with degradation however this version does not.
