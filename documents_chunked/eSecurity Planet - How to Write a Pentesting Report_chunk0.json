A pentest report should also outline the vulnerability scans and simulated cybersecurity attacks the pentester used to probe for weaknesses in an organization’s overall security stack or specific systems, such as websites, applications, networks, and cloud infrastructure. To be truly useful, the report must be more than a simple list. Penetration test reports deliver the only tangible evidence of the pentest process and must deliver value for a broad range of readers and purposes. We explore the art of writing effective penetration testing reports in the sections below: How to Write a Great Pentest Report in 6 Steps The process of writing a great penetration test report is straightforward and can be covered in six key steps. Each step builds on the previous step to increase the quality of the information, the organization of the findings, and the usability of the report for stakeholders. × FlexJobs 1.

Capture the technical details: Include notes, screenshots, and log files in the report, but to make documentation less disruptive, take video and narrate while conducting the pentest and take screenshots later. 3. Start with a rough draft: Begin with the most significant vulnerabilities, remediations, and overall results. Don’t worry about grammar, spelling, or complete sentences just yet. 4. Categorize and summarize key findings: Including criticality, vulnerability, system, and other important findings will help clients address issues by the level of risk they pose. 5. Revise the draft: Here’s where you focus on grammar, punctuation, and spelling to turn the content into plain, formal English, using non-technical language to help IT generalists and managers understand the risks. 6. Organize and proofread: Double check the information to eliminate errors, make the report easy to read, and to focus on the most important findings; move non-critical information to appendices. Although the process is simple enough, a quality report relies on the proper execution of this process and the inclusion of expected information.
