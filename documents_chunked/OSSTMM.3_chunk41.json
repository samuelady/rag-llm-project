{"text": "something reserved for risk analysis. In security analysis, you study and measure the attack surface of and around a target. This will allow you then to understand where the threats, any threats, can attack if they do attack. For example, consider a long, high wall. The risk analysis will consider what can get through the wall but the security analysis will focus on where the cracks are, if the foundation is solid, and if the wall is thick or tall enough to prevent Access long enough for help to arrive and respond to the attack. A security analysis will also allow you to assure the right controls exist, work the way they should, and properly cover the interactive points of the various accessible vectors and channels.

That idea may be an answer, a conclusion, or a characterization of something or someone so that verification tests can be well defined. As an answer or a conclusion, critical security thinking will provide that which makes the most sense. As a characterization, it will show you what you need to verify, according to what you need to verify, according to what vector, how, and what the targets will be. It will also help you respect different opinions or viewpoints beyond security itself to the interconnectedness security makes with people, places, processes, and money. It will help you address contradictory conclusions and explore alternate consequences. So even if the critical security thinking model canâ€™t provide an answer it should tell you what facts are still missing and from where you need to get them. The process of critical security thinking is dependent on the Analyst being able to discern true statements or at least recognize the degree of possible falsity or dynamic properties in a statement. One way to do this is to recognize the amount of trust you can have in a fact through the use of trust metrics. Another way is to be able to deconstruct a statement, separating out fallacious arguments. In practice, an Analyst will need to do both. The Analyst will need to have a good understanding of what is being analyzed and a good understanding of logical fallacies used to make qualifiers, statements based on fallacious concepts usually in the form of axioms or best practices. The Six Step Analysis Technique Unfortunately, the world is not prescriptive. Not every question has a right answer. The correctness of an answer is dependent on many things including, most importantly, how it is asked. This is a problem affecting all industries but none so obviously as security which is why critical security thinking is so important. As a technique for analysis it can be reduced to 6 simple steps to ascertain factual results with a high trust level for correctness even when solutions are not linear", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 41}}
