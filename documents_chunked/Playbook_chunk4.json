{"text": "users to make, safeguard, and remember their own passwords is a system that’s going to be difficult (if not impossible) to defend. According to what OSSTMM researchers refer to as “The Somebody Sequence,” the more interaction somebody has in the security process, the greater its attack surface. Asking employees to manage their own passwords is like giving them full control over the keys to an important lock. You can purchase one of the strongest locks money can buy, but how secure can it ultimately be if there are keys for it floating around everywhere? THE OPEN SOURCE CYBERSECURITY PLAYBOOK\\nPART 1: SCOUTING REPORTS 8 Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) What it is: There is only so much traffic a computer system can process before it starts to slow down and becomes overwhelmed. By gaining control over a large number of hijacked systems and devices (referred to as a botnet), attackers can direct large amounts of connection requests or packets of random data at a single target all at once, with the intention of overloading the system and taking it offline. What makes protection a challenge: The larger the botnet, the more damage a DDoS attack can do. The best you can hope for when you’re attacked is that you’re subscribed to an anti-DDoS service, but even that doesn’t provide a guarantee you’ll stay up and running if you’re dealing with an attack with a high level of magnitude. To make matters worse, sometimes attackers will contact their targets ahead of time and threaten to knock them offline unless “protection money” is paid up front. It can be difficult to discern whether such threats or simply scams, and — as is the case with ransomware — giving in to criminal extortion demands never comes with a guarantee. Scareware What it is: You’ve probably seen the pop-ups — “Warning! A virus has been detected on your computer. Download VirusBlaster to clean and remove it.” The malware that really infects your computer is the program that pop-up is trying to trick you into downloading. Scareware can come in a variety of forms from fake antivirus programs to fake browsers or software updates. What makes protection a challenge: We know that social engineering works because it preys on the distracted and mentally fatigued. Combine that with eagerness to please or help and thus begins the “good intentions” downward spiral that leads employees to make really bad decisions. Once scareware gets inside the system it has all the privileges, passwords, and logins of the employee who installed it. Getting it out may be as easy as just wiping the system and starting fresh or recovering from backup. Or it may be more difficult and time- consuming if the malware spreads to other systems.
