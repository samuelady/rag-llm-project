{"text": "Once the computer system is powered on and the operating system is loaded, however, many full disk encryption solutions will transparently decrypt and encrypt files accessed by the user. For example, if a laptop encrypted with a full disk encryption solution in a manner consistent with HHS guidance8 is properly shut down and powered off and then lost or stolen, the data on the laptop would be unreadable, unusable and indecipherable to anyone other than the authenticated user. Because the PHI on the laptop is not “unsecured PHI”, a covered entity or business associate need not perform a risk assessment to determine a low probability of compromise or provide breach notification. However, in contrast to the above example, if the laptop is powered on and in use by an authenticated user, who then performs an action (clicks on a link to a malicious website, opens an attachment from a phishing email, etc.) that infects the laptop with ransomware, there could be a breach of PHI. If full disk encryption is the only encryption solution in use to protect the PHI and if the ransomware accesses the file containing the PHI, the file containing the PHI will be transparently decrypted by the full disk encryption solution and access permitted with the same access levels granted to the user. Because the file containing the PHI was decrypted and thus “unsecured PHI” at the point in time that the ransomware accessed the file, an impermissible disclosure of PHI was made and a breach is presumed. Under the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule, notification in accordance with 45 CFR 164.404 is required unless the entity can demonstrate a low probability of compromise of the PHI based on the four factor risk assessment (see 45 C.F.R. 164.402(2)). 8 HHS guidance to render unsecured PHI unusable, unreadable or indecipherable to unauthorized individuals indicates that encryption solutions for data-at-rest must be consistent with NISP SP 800-111, Guide to Storage Encryption Technologies for End User Devices, in order for encrypted PHI to not be “unsecured PHI”. It must be noted, however, that consistency with NIST SP 800-111 requires not only the consideration of an encryption algorithm, but also consideration of additional areas of an encryption solution including encryption methodologies (e.g., full disk, virtual disk/volume, folder/file), cryptographic key management, and pre-boot authentication, where applicable. 8", "metadata": {"doc_id": "RansomwareFactSheet", "chunk_id": 7}}
