All rights reserved. Page 29 of 34\\nRisk Rating The overall risk identified to MegaCorp One as a result of the penetration test is High. A direct path from external attacker to full system compromise was discovered. It is reasonable to believe that a malicious entity would be able to successfully execute an attack against MegaCorp One through targeted attacks.

Page 30 of 34\\nAppendix A: Vulnerability Detail and Mitigation Risk Rating Scale In accordance with NIST SP 800-30, exploited vulnerabilities are ranked based upon likelihood and impact to determine overall risk. Default or Weak Credentials Rating: High Description: An externally exposed administrative interface is only protected with a weak password. Impact: Using common enumeration and brute-forcing techniques, it is possible to retrieve the administrative password for the SQLite Manager web interface. Due to the lack of any additional authentication mechanisms, it is also possible to retrieve all user password hashes in the underlying database. Successful retrieval of plaintext passwords could allow further compromise of the target environment if password reuse is found to exist. Remediation: Ensure that all administrative interfaces are protected with complex passwords or passphrases. Avoid use of common or business related words, which could be found or easily constructed with the help of a dictionary. PTR-20130513 Copyright © 2013 Offensive Security Services LLC.

Page 31 of 34\\nPassword Reuse Rating: High Description: MegaCorp One user “mike” was found to be reusing credentials for the SQLite Manager application and his Windows domain access. Impact: Password reuse in general is a practice which should be highly discouraged and prevented to the extend possible. In this case, the impact of the vulnerability is amplified by the fact that an external attacker indirectly compromised a valid set of internal Windows domain credentials. This compromise potentially allows a substantial increase in the attack surface. Remediation: Update the password management policies to enforce the use of strong, unique, passwords for all disparate services. The use of password managers should be encouraged to more easily allow employees to utilize unique passwords across the various systems. Shared Local Administrator Password Rating: High Description: A number of MegaCorp One hosts are provisioned with the same local administrator password. Impact: MegaCorp One uses a Group Policy to set a local administrator password on all hosts within the scope of the GPO. Using the same local administrator password on corporate systems allows an attacker with appropriate access to utilize the well-known “pass-the-hash” attack vector. It allows an attacker to successfully authenticate on all hosts that share the same password, using", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Offensive Security - sample-penetration-testing-report", "chunk_id": 9}}
