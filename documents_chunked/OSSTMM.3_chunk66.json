{"text": "of the 10 Loss Controls balance the value of 1 OpSec loss (visibility, access, trust) it is necessary to determine the amount of Missing Controls, MC , in order to assess the sum value of the Security Limitations. This must be done individually for each of the 10 Loss Control categories. For example, to determine the Missing Controls for Authentication (MC ) we must subtract the sum of Au Authentication Controls (LC ) of the scope from the OpSec . The Missing Controls can never be less Au sum than zero however. The equation for determining the Missing Controls for Authentication (MC ) is given by Au IF OpSec - LC 0 sum Au THEN MC 0 Au ELSE MC  OpSec LC . Au sum Au The resulting Missing Control totals for each of the 10 Loss Controls must then be added to arrive at the total Missing Control value (MC ) as seen below. sum MC  MC MC MC MC MC MC MC MC MC MC sum Au Id Re Su Ct NR It Pr Cf Al Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution-Non-Commercial-NoDerivs 2010, ISECOM, www.isecom.org, www.osstmm.org 81\\nTrue Controls True Controls (TC ) is the inverse of Missing Controls which means the True Controls for each individual sum control also need to be calculated before the results can be tallied into TC . sum The equation for determining the True Controls for Authentication (TC ) is given by Au TC OpSec MC Au sum Au The resulting True Control totals for each of the 10 Loss Controls must then be added to arrive at the total True Control value (TC ) as seen below. sum TC  TC TC TC TC TC TC TC TC TC TC sum Au Id Re Su Ct NR It Pr Cf Al True Controls are used to measure the ideal placement of controls. The base value also helps to eliminate the influence of a disproportionate placement of controls on security. The True Controls base (TC ) base value is given as: TC  log21100(OpSec MC 0.1). base sum sum Based on the same idea as True Controls, True Coverage (TCvg) can be used to measure the percentage of controls in place regarding the optimal amount and placement of controls. True Coverage is then derived using the Missing Control totals and the following equation: IF OpSec  0 sum THEN TCvg 0 MC ELSE TCvg 1 sum . 10OpSec sum Full Controls Full Controls, on the other hand, take into account all controls in place regardless of a balanced distribution. This value is important for measuring the worth of two-factor authentication, for example, and other instances of defense in depth for the same visibility, access or trust.
