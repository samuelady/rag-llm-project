{"text": "Does not meet: Regular Patching and Updates: Ensure that all software, including operating systems, applications, and security tools, are regularly patched and updated with the latest security patches and updates to address known vulnerabilities and weaknesses Strong Authentication and Access Controls: Enforce the use of strong, unique passwords for all user accounts, implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible, and restrict user access permissions based on the principle of least privilege to limit potential exposure to unauthorized access Incident Response Plan: Develop and maintain an incident response plan that outlines roles and responsibilities, communication protocols, and steps to mitigate and recover from security incidents. Regularly review and update the plan to reflect changes in the threat landscape and organizational environment Threat Hunt & Threat Intelligence Monitoring: Implement continuous monitoring of corporate data, domains and user’s to detect and respond to potential security incidents, such as fraudulent activities, data breaches and leakage, or compromised user’s data such as emails, passwords, etc. Partially meet: Secure Network Architecture: Implement a secure network architecture that includes network segmentation, firewalls, and intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDPS) to isolate critical systems and data from potential threats and control access to sensitive information Compliance with Industry Standards: Ensure compliance with relevant industry standards, regulations, and frameworks, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), National Institute of Standards and Technology Please be informed that this is an incomplete version of the UnderDefense Internal Penetration Testing Report.

Meets best practices: Backup and Disaster Recovery: Regularly back up critical data and establish a robust disaster recovery plan to ensure that data can be restored in the event of a cybersecurity incident or data loss Secure Remote Access: Implement secure remote access mechanisms, such as virtual private networks (VPNs) or secure remote desktop protocols, with strong authentication and access controls to protect against unauthorized access to the organization's networks and systems. Providing recommendations that [CLIENT_NAME] can implement to mitigate threats and vulnerabilities and meet industry best practice Completed: recommendations were provided in section “1.5 High-Level Recommendations” 1.2 Scope, Timeframe and Limitations Testing and verification were performed between [DATE]. The scope of this project was limited to the [CLIENT_NAME] internal network. We conducted the tests using a production version of the [CLIENT_NAME] internal network. All other servers were out of scope. All testing and verification were conducted from outside of [CLIENT_NAME] offices. User Accounts provided by [CLIENT_NAME] The following hosts were considered to be in scope for testing. Scope Description Internal Network Scope [NETWORK_SCOPE] Network Devices Scope [NETWORK_DEVICES_SCOPE] WiFi Testing Scope [WIFI_SCOPE] Limitations This security assessment was conducted for [CLIENT_NAME] production environment and valid on the date of the report submission hereto. The description of findings, recommendations, and risks was valid on the date of submission the report hereto.
