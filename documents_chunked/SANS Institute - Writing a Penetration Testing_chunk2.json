Report audiences include Information Security Manager, Chief Information Security Officer, Information Technology Manager and technical teams. More information about the scope and target audiences can be found also in the scope of work of the assignment. Report classification Since Penetration Testing Report have sensitive information such as, servers IP addresses and its information, some applications information, vulnerability, threats, exploits and more, it should be considered to be in every high rank of confidentiality e.g. TOP SECRET and the report will be dealt with accordingly. The report classification will be based on the target organization information classification policy. )*+,%\"&(!.$*&/01(2$*&/0342*0.-5%2( ( ( @ 2021 SANS Institute Author Retains Full Rights\\n! !
