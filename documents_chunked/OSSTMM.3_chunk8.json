This manual is adaptable to almost any audit type, including penetration tests, ethical hacking, security assessments, vulnerability assessments, red-teaming, blue-teaming, and so forth. It is written as a security research document and is designed for factual security verification and presentation of metrics on a professional level. A secondary purpose is to provide guidelines which, when followed correctly, will allow the analyst to perform a certified OSSTMM audit. These guidelines exist to assure the following: 1. The test was conducted thoroughly. 2. The test included all necessary channels. 3. The posture for the test complied with the law. 4. The results are measurable in a quantifiable way. 5. The results are consistent and repeatable. 6. The results contain only facts as derived from the tests themselves. An indirect benefit of this manual is that it can act as a central reference in all security tests regardless of the size of the organization, technology, or protection. Document Scope The scope of this document is to provide specific descriptions for operational security tests over all operational channels, which include Human, Physical, Wireless, Telecommunications, and Data Networks, over any vector, and the description of derived metrics. This manual only focuses on OpSec and the use of the words safety and security are within this context. Liability This manual describes certain tests which are designed to elicit a response. Should these tests cause harm or damage, the Analyst may be liable according to the laws governing the Analyst’s location as well as the location of the tested systems. ISECOM makes no guarantee as to a harmless outcome of any test. Any Analyst applying this methodology cannot hold ISECOM liable for problems which arise during testing. In using this methodology, the Analyst agrees to assume this liability.

The STAR must also meet the reporting requirements in this manual. The STAR can be submitted to ISECOM for review and official ISECOM certification. A certified test and an accredited report does not need to show that this entire manual or any specific subsections were followed. It needs only show what was and was not tested to be applicable for certification. (See Chapter 16, Making the STAR for details and an example of a STAR.) A certified OSSTMM audit provides the following benefits:  Serves as proof of a factual test  Holds Analyst responsible for the test  Provides a clear result to the client  Provides a more", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 8}}
