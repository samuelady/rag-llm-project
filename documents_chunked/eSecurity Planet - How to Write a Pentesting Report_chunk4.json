Pentest report writers must keep these three factors in mind: Penetration test objectives that will vary at different levels of the organization Useful pentest results must be provided to extract value Tips and cautions to maximize the value of the report Penetration Test Objectives When authorizing a penetration test, an organization seeks to test their existing security controls for the systems authorized for testing. To deliver value on this investment, the penetration test writer must display the professionalism and competence of the testers clearly, both through the results of the test and the effective communication of the results. The penetration test report content must reflect the objectives of a diverse set of stakeholders: Executives and board members will want to see value for their investment and need a clear and understandable non-technical summary Technical teams will want clear, detailed, and actionable information that can be used to remedy discovered vulnerabilities Compliance and legal teams will need penetration test results that clearly show how the organization satisfies their compliance obligations Penetration testers, of course, want to demonstrate the quality of their skills and the satisfaction of the objectives of the testing Ã— process Useful Pentest Results https://www.esecurityplanet.com/networks/pentest-report/ 4/11\\nPenetration test results will be used to determine resource allocations, remediation requirements, justify the acquisition of new cybersecurity tools, and determine the urgency of corrective action. Usable reports enable these goals efficiently and effectively. The key factors for usability are: clear presentation, client customization, and standardized ratings. Clear Presentation The pen test report writer must consider how to clearly present: Importance of Key Findings Overall findings Recommended Remediations Technical details Tested systems and methods used Often tables and graphics help for easy digestion of information and should be used frequently. Similarly, a pen test report should be written as clearly and concisely as possible for clear and quick understanding. Client Customization Although key findings will typically be listed by severity and overall findings will tend to be listed by system, a pen test report should be customized to the needs of the client. For example, in a large enterprise, there may be separate groups responsible for networks and for application development. This type of organization will likely want reports with completely segregated key findings and overall results organized by team responsibility. Standardized Ratings A simple good / bad rating will not convey enough information, but will be equally as useful as an overly complex matrix of, say, three categories of eight possible ratings levels. To be most usable, ratings need to mirror ratings systems familiar to the technical teams. The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) list developed by MITRE or scores based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) will be familiar to all technical staff and are not too", "metadata": {"doc_id": "eSecurity Planet - How to Write a Pentesting Report", "chunk_id": 4}}
