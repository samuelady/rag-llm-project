Testing this channel requires non-communicative interaction with barriers and humans in gatekeeper positions of assets. This channel covers the interaction of the Analyst within proximity of the targets. While some services consider this simply as “breaking and entering”, the true compliance objective of security testing in this channel is physical and logical barrier testing and gap measurement to the required security standard as outlined in company policy, industry regulations, or regional legislation. The Analyst will be required to have multiple tools and methods for the completion of some tasks to assure that suspicion is not raised among personnel and tests are not made invalid due to an early discovery or heightened paranoia. It may also be pertinent to limit test subjects to one per department or other boundary. Analysts will also need to be prepared for the possibility of accidental bodily harm from conventional barriers and weapons, interactions with animals, subjection to harmful bacteria, viruses, and fungi, exposure to electromagnetic and microwave radiation, especially that which can permanently damage hearing or sight, and poisonous or corrosive chemical agents in any form. Competent Analysts will require physical strength, endurance, agility, and critical thinking skills to assure factual data collection creates factual results through correlation and analysis.

Conatus: All attempts to traverse physical barriers require an unbiased judgment of the amount of difficulty required to reach and interact with the target and the danger involved. These considerations are to be made with regard to the “will to live” of humans as well as any effect on the targets should the attack be made without regard for life (suicidal). 2. Ecce hora: All physical tests require close attention be made to time. Records must be kept of the time the test is made, time on target, and time the test finishes, whether successful or not, because that will also assist in determining what can be accomplished within the time range to fail. Knowing such information can help understand what may be a deceptive attack so as to be sure", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 90}}
