Client has three unique brands running on multiple e-commerce web sites. Brand A runs on a third-party e-commerce platform written using a Java platform with Apache Tomcat and IBM’s DB2 database and utilizes a content-delivery network for image distribution. Brand B and Brand C utilize an in-house coded e-commerce shopping cart written in ColdFusion with Microsoft SQL and share the same underlying code. All brands submit cardholder data for processing over HTTPS. All sites are hosted at a third-party hosting provider on dedicated systems. The Client’s firewalls have integrated intrusion prevention features. Client has exclusive control of the code and the content. Product Managers update product information using staging servers in the corporate environment, and the updates are promoted to production by IT support staff. Client has full control of DNS. Description of Environment The environment for Brands A, B, and C is comprised of five networks. The web DMZ contains the firewalls, DNS servers, load balancers, and web servers for all brands. Only the load balancers are NAT’d and have publicly routable IP addresses. The application tier contains the Apache Tomcat and ColdFusion middleware servers. It is segmented from the DMZ and database tiers using firewall access controls. The database tier contains the Microsoft SQL and IBM DB2 servers. It is segmented from the application tier using firewall access controls. The management network is used for backups, patch-management servers, NTP Servers, network-traffic analysis devices, and syslog collectors. The management network is accessible using jump boxes with two-factor authentication from the corporate network over a point-to-point VPN. Pre-Engagement Activities (Planning) Once the engagement is confirmed, the Pen Test Company scheduled a kick-off call and provided the Client with a testing questionnaire and test-authorization form to be completed before the next meeting. The kick-off call is generally used to review the rules of engagement, define the success criteria, and review the methodology to be used. An examination of this type could be conducted in accordance with information system security assessment best practices such as described by the Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (“OSSTMM”), The National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Special Publication 800-115, Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment, or the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) testing methodology as defined in the OWASP Testing Guide v.3.0.
