{"text": "customers access to their cardholder data, authenticated testing should be performed to ensure customer access is properly restricted to only their own cardholder data. The customer should provide the penetration tester with credentials that have equivalent permission(s) as a customer user, to allow the penetration tester to determine whether those credentials allow access to data beyond the entity’s data. 2.3.2 PA-DSS Compliant Applications If a payment application has been PA-DSS validated, the application’s functionality does not need to be tested as part of the entity’s PCI DSS compliance validation. However, the implementation of the application does need to be tested. This includes both the operating system and any exposed services, but not the payment application’s functionality (e.g., authentication, key management, transaction processing, etc.) since this was validated as part of the PA-DSS application validation. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

Instead, the tester should perform a network-layer test and ensure the software was implemented, configured, and is currently being maintained in a secure manner (disabling or uninstalling unused services, blocking unused ports, applying current updates, etc.). 2.3.4 Separate Testing Environment Because of the nature and the intent of penetration testing, such testing in a production environment during normal business hours may impact business operations, and attempts to avoid disruption may increase the time, resources and complexity of the testing. This is especially important for high availability systems that may be impacted by penetration testing in a production environment. To avoid disruptions and to speed up testing, a separate environment that is identical to the production environment may be used for testing instead of the production environment. The penetration tester would need to ensure the same application and network-layer controls as production exist in the testing environment. This may be accomplished through methods to map out the production environment to verify it matches the testing environment. This should be included in the rules of engagement. All exploitable vulnerabilities identified during the testing must be corrected on production systems and testing repeated to verify that security weaknesses have been addressed. 2.4 Segmentation Checks PCI DSS Requirement 11.3.4 requires penetration testing to validate that segmentation controls and methods are operational, effective, and isolate all out-of-scope systems from systems in the CDE. Therefore, a robust approach to penetration testing is recommended to satisfy this requirement by actively attempting to identify routes and paths from networks outside the CDE into the CDE. All segmentation methods need to be specifically tested. In very large networks, with numerous internal LAN segments, it may be infeasible for the penetration tester to conduct specific tests", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Penetration-Testing-Guidance-v1_1", "chunk_id": 6}}
