For example, up to 5 points may be earned by submitting your lab report along with your exercises. Although submitting your PWK lab report and the corresponding course exercises is completely optional, it is not difficult to see why it’s highly recommended to do so . This document is provided as an example of what is expected, at minimum, in a typical lab report that is submitted for review. You must successfully compromise no less than 10 machines in the labs and document all of your steps as illustrated in the “Offensive Security Lab and Exam Penetration Report: Section 3 - Methodologies” template. You may choose to include more than 10 machines in your report, however this will not provide any additional points to your final exam score. The sample report presented in this document has been adapted for the non-native English speaker. For that reason, Offensive Security has opted for a more visual (i.e: more screenshots) style of reporting. A narrative of how the machine was compromised as well as vulnerability information can be included in the report, at your discretion. Please note that this template is only a guide, you may opt not to use it and create your own. The report, regardless of the template used, must be clear, concise, and most importantly, it must be reproducible. In other words, we must be able to compromise the machine again by simply following the report. 2 | P a g e\\nTable of Contents 1.0 Offensive Security Lab and Exam Penetration Test Report .............................................................. 4 1.1 Introduction ....................................................................................................................................... 4 1.2 Objective ............................................................................................................................................ 4 1.3 Requirements ..................................................................................................................................... 4 2.0 Report – High-Level Summary ......................................................................................................... 5 2.1 Report - Recommendations ............................................................................................................... 5 3.0 Report – Methodologies ................................................................................................................. 5 3.1 Report – Information Gathering ......................................................................................................... 6 3.2 Report – Service Enumeration ........................................................................................................... 6 3.3 Report – Penetration .......................................................................................................................... 7 3.4 Report – House Cleaning .................................................................................................................. 14 4.0 PWK Course Exercises ................................................................................................................... 14 3 | P a g e\\n1.0 Offensive Security Lab and Exam Penetration Test Report 1.1 Introduction The Offensive Security Lab and Exam penetration test report should contain all the steps taken to successfully compromise machines both in the exam and lab environments.
