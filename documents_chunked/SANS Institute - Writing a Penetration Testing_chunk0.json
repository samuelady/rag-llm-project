A lot of currently available penetration testing resources lack report writing ! methodology and approach which leads to a very big gap in the penetration testing cycle. ! ! Report in its definition is a statement of the results of an investigation or of any matter on ! which definite information is required (Oxford English Dictionary). ! ! A penetration test is useless without something tangible to give to a client or ! executive officer. A report should detail the outcome of the test and, if you are making ! ! recommendations, document the recommendations to secure any high-risk systems ! (Whitaker & Newman, 2005). Report Writing is a crucial part for any service providers ! ! especially in IT service/ advisory providers. In pen-testing the final result is a report that ! shows the services provided, the methodology adopted, as well as testing results and ! ! recommendations. As one of the project managers at major electronics firm Said \"We ! don't actually manufacture anything. Most of the time, the tangible products of this ! ! department [engineering] are reports.\" There is an old saying that in the consulting ! business: “If you do not document it, it did not happen.” (Smith, LeBlanc & Lam, 2004) ! \"#$!%&'(#)*)&'+!,!-./0!.-12!1.03!0045!.567!5895!.467!:;83!-/;0!383;! Many people consider business reports as dry, uninteresting documents, which take a great deal of time and efforts to prepare. The reality is that they are an essential part of doing business and one's ability to be proficient in this area is critical to the ability to pursue commercial success (McCarthy, 1979; Ronstadt, 1984; Thompson, 2003c). Penetration testing report presents the approach followed and the results of the vulnerability assessment and penetration test of a target system with a detailed recommendation of how to mitigate the risks. Target reader for the penetration testing report will vary, executive summary will be read by the senior management and the technical details will be read by the IT and/or information security responsible people. This paper begins with a conventional approach to develop a penetration testing report starting from collecting information, drafting the first report and ending with a professional report. As shown in figure 1 the penetration testing report writing stages are: Report planning, Information collection, writing the first draft and reviewing and finalization. )*+,%\"&(!.$*&/01(2$*&/0342*0.-5%2( ( ( @ 2021 SANS Institute Author Retains Full Rights\\n! !
