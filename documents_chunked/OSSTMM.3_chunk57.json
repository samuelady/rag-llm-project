{"text": "with an unknown, but perhaps acceptable, error margin. The end result is a calculation for Actual Security. It applies multiple controls of the same type to satisfy double-enforcement requirements like 2-factor Authentication. It also uses Log10 to reduce large numbers into human-manageable form. People generally like to work with smaller numbers and especially as percentages which are easier to visualize. For a small scope, the accuracy of using Log10 as a reduction technique is negligible. However, if you have a very large scope with many targets you may want to work with the very large numbers for greater accuracy. Additionally if you want to see the true balance where multiple controls of the same type are not measured, that calculation can be found under the heading of True Protection. Combining Channels and Vectors One important requirement in applying the rav is that Actual Security can only be calculated per scope. A change in channel, vector, or index is a new scope and a new calculation for Actual Security. However, once calculated, multiple scopes can be combined together in aggregate to create one Actual Security that represents a fuller vision of the operational security all scopes. For example, a test can be made of Internet-facing servers from both the Internet side and from within the perimeter network where the servers reside. That is 2 vectors. Assume that, the Internet vector is indexed by IP address and contains 50 targets. The intranet vector is indexed by MAC address and is made of 100 targets because less controls exist internally to allow for more collaborative interaction between systems. Once each test is completed and the rav is counted they can be combined into one calculation of 150 targets as well as the sums of each limitations and controls. This will give a final Actual Security metric which is more complete for that perimeter network than either test would provide alone. It would also be possible to add the analysis from physical security, wireless, telecommunications, and human security tests in the same way. Such combinations are possible to create a better understanding of the total security in a holistic way.

This spreadsheet is available at the ISECOM website. The Analyst need only enter the values into the empty, white boxes and the rest of the calculations will be handled automatically.

The number of targets in the scope that can be determined to exist by direct interaction, indirect interaction, or passive emanations is its visibility.
