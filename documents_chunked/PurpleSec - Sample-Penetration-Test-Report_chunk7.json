{"text": "found to be feasible to induce CELxIa mple’s users to provide logon information through deceptive telephone communications. Recommendations: • Conduct Social Engineering Training to help staff properly validate the identity of the phone callers and do not provide confidential credential information. • Ensure procedures have employees report unusual or suspicious phone calls to appropriate staff. • Change password requirements to at least 10 complex characters, including alpha-numeric and special characters. sales@purplesec.us 22\\nPEN TEST REPORT: EXAMPLE INSTITUTE JANUARY28,2019 4.4 Current Zone Activities: PurpleSec’s Social Engineer worked CwLitIh staff to compile 175 email addresses to perform the social engineering test. A phishing template with appropriate signage and logos was created. Nexus Point Activities: PurpleSec’s Social Engineer sent a phishing e-mail to all the in-scope addresses. The e- mail originated from a spurious IT support company and claimed to be a legitimate technical support request authorized by CLIENT’s IT Department. The e-mail also requested that the user navigate to an PurpleSec-controlled Website and: • Provide his/her domain username, • Provide his/her e-mail address (in lieu of password), and • Download a benign executable file, • Run the executable locally on his/her workstation. Of the 175 email addresses tested, 13 users interacted with untrusted content (hyperlink) and 9 provided domain usernames/e-mail address. Figure 3.49 – Screenshot showing the email phishing results. Risk Rating: Medium Bottom Line: The response and click rates for CLIENT’s staff tested via email are just under 10% and should be considered a vulnerability for the organization. It should be noted that most malware needs only a single response, and full response from a user to username/password requests may lead to significant breaches. sales@purplesec.us 23\\nPEN TEST REPORT: EXAMPLE INSTITUTE JANUARY28,2019 Recommendations: • While click and interaction rates were calculated as Medium it is highly recommended that CLIENT engage in Cybersecurity awareness training immediately. 5.0 Conclusions 5.1 Most Likely Compromise Scenarios An attacker would most likely start an attack against CLEINT with social engineering techniques. (this is the most successful type of attack) and given that ETERNALBLUE is easily exploited, this is the most likely compromise of the entire system. Attacking the McAfee Security Server would be an ideal first target; once an attacker has attained root access to this system, they can disable all the security controls and systems in place, allowing for much more evasive traversal of the internal network, as well as potentially creating more targets without the hindrance of the security systems. From here, the ideal goals of an attacker would be data exfiltration of ePHI, Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and PCI data - for purposes of fraud, ransom, targeted phishing, sale, etc. - and any payment information that may be available for similar purposes. An adversary would attempt to access to the Domain Controllers to help facilitate network traversal and further compromise of security controls and monitoring systems. With Domain access, complete infrastructure compromise is likely; with this level of access an attacker presents numerous serious security risks to critical and confidential information systems.
