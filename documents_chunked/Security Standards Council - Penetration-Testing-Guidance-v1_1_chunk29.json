External Penetration Test Testing included evaluation of the following Internet-facing resources:  Six store public IPs Internal Penetration Testing Based on information that all stores are configured identically, internal testing was performed against two stores. Any vulnerabilities identified are assumed to exist in all stores. Testing included evaluation of the following unique testing perspectives targeting two store POS networks: Table x: Network-layer penetration testing scope Perspective network Targeted Network Corporate IT Network Store # 1 – POS Network Corporate IT Network Store # 2 – POS Network Table y: Segmentation testing scope Perspective network Targeted Network Corporate general user network Store # 1 – POS Network Store 1 – general network Store # 1 – POS Network Corporate general user network Store # 2 – POS Network Store 2 – general network Store # 2 – POS Network Pre-Test Preparations The penetration tester was given a network level access in each of the defined testing perspectives.  Corporate IT Network  Corporate General User Network  Store 1 General Network  Store 2 General Network The penetration tester was also provided with the internal IP information for the POS network at the sample target store. No other network access or user credentials were provided. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 38\\nEngagement Phase The success criteria for the penetration test were defined as getting access to the CDE environment and accessing cardholder data. Based on the defined scope, the following different attack scenarios were evaluated:  External attacker without knowledge of the environment  Internal attacker with no CDE access (guest, contractor, etc.) in either the store general network, or the corporate general network  Internal attacker gaining unauthorized access to the corporate IT management network segment and pivoting to attack stores as an administrator Reporting Phase The penetration tester reported the following items after completing the test. External Penetration Test No notable items reported. It was determined that the only publicly reachable services were the VPN connection points, which were vetted and determined to be secure. Internal Penetration Test Outlined below are the vulnerabilities identified during the internal penetration test.  Vulnerability #1 – Segmentation failure Summary: It was found that firewall #2 (CDE firewall) was configured to allow unrestricted access (all ports and services) from the store General Network (10.0.0.0/24) into the store POS Network (192.168.0.0/24).  Vulnerability #2 – Default user credentials on POS server Summary: Default credentials were enabled on the third-party application running on the POS server. Using these credentials, the penetration tester was able to obtain administrative-level access to the POS server. Post-Engagement Green Clothing reviewed the penetration test report and implemented fixes for each identified item. The penetration tester conducted additional testing to validate", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Security Standards Council - Penetration-Testing-Guidance-v1_1", "chunk_id": 29}}
