These objectives are used across the information security industry although due in part to their over-simplification, they are more for the benefit of managing it rather than creating it or testing it. The mapping is not a perfect 1:1 however it is sufficient to demonstrate operation controls according to the basic CIA Triad. Because the definitions used for CIA are very broad the mappings appear to be as such: Information Assurance Objectives Operation Controls Confidentiality Privacy Confidentiality Authentication Resilience Integrity Non-repudiation Integrity Subjugation Continuity Indemnification Availability Alarm Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution-Non-Commercial-NoDerivs 2010, ISECOM, www.isecom.org, www.osstmm.org 27\\n1.4 Limitations The inability of protection mechanisms to work are their limitations. Therefore the state of security in regard to known flaws and restrictions within the operations scope is called Limitation. It is the holes, vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and problems in keeping that separation between an asset and a threat or in assuring controls continue working correctly. Limitations have been classified into five categories and these categories define the type of vulnerability, mistake, misconfiguration, or deficiency by operation. This is different from how limitations are classified under most security management frameworks and best practices which is why we use the term Limitation rather than more common terms to avoid confusion. Those other terms refer to vulnerabilities or deficiencies because they are categorized by the type of attack or often the threat itself. There is a focus on the risk from the attack. However, to remove bias from security metrics and provide a more fair assessment we removed the use of risk. Risk itself is heavily biased and often highly variable depending on the environment, assets, threats, and many more factors. Therefore, under OpSec, we use the term Limitations to express the difference of categorizing how OpSec fails rather than by the type of threat. Since the number and type of threats cannot be known it makes more sense to understand a security or safety mechanism based on when it will fail. This allows the Analyst to test for the conditions in which it will no longer sustain the necessary level of protection. Only once we have this knowledge can we begin to play the what-if game of threats and risks. Then we can also invest in the appropriate type of separation or controls required and create precise plans for disasters and contingencies. Although the Limitations are categorized here as 1 through 5 this does not mean they are in a hierarchical format of severity. Rather they are numbered only to differentiate them", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 19}}
