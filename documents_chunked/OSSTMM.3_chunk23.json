{"text": "is effectively demonstrating Actual Security. Actual Security is a term for a snapshot of an attack surface in an operational environment. It is a logarithmic representation of the Controls, Limitations, and OpSec at a particular moment in time. It is logarithmic because it represents the reality of size where a larger scope will have a larger attack surface even if mathematically the Controls will balance the OpSec. Using this as building blocks to better understand how security works, the visualization that we create from this is the effective balance created between where an attack can occur, where the Controls are in place to manage an attack, and the limitations of the protective measures. Another benefit of mathematical representation of an attack surface as Actual Security is that besides just showing where protection measures are lacking it can also show the opposite. Since it is possible to have more controls than one needs this can be mathematically represented as more than 100% rav. Whether a risk assessment may make this point seem impossible, the mathematical representation is useful for showing waste. It can be used to prove when money is being overspent on the wrong types of controls or redundant controls. 1.6 Compliance Compliance is a different thing than security and exists separate from security. It is possible to be compliant yet not secure and it is possible to be relatively secure but non-compliant and therefore of low trustworthiness. Compliance projects are not the time to redefine operational security requirements as a result of an OSSTMM test, they may however be the time to specify the use of OSSTMM testing, on a periodic basis, to fulfill a control requirement drafted as a result of a trust assessment that has scoped the minimum number of controls required to achieve a compliant (but not necessarily secure) state. The big problem with compliance is it requires a lot of documentation that has to be versioned and updated. This documentation can be of business processes, narratives, trust assessments, risk assessments, signed off design tests, operational audits, attestations, and so on and on. This documentation is scrutinized by internal and external auditors and has to logically fulfill its existence in the world of a compliant state. Most recent compliance efforts have been driven by the short term requirements of imposed regulations with short term implementation requirements. This has created a lot of resource requirements and cost. Given time to think about it we try to build compliance and evidence production into a process and manage this resource requirement and cost. Compliance is a broad brush approach to the application of best practice from, as far as Information Technology is concerned, the likes of COBIT and ITIL; an OSSTMM test should provide documentation that provides an understandable, verifiable level of quality. The use of the OSSTMM, however, is designed to allow the Analyst to view and understand security and safety. Therefore, with the use of this methodology, any compliance is, at least, the production of evidence of", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 23}}
