{"text": "THOR Network Zone: This network is the CDE environment where TechMerchant has its virtual servers located; all servers located at this network are in PCI scope. The network is separated into smaller networks: DMZ, secure database zone, and an application zone. These networks are included in the penetration test performed at TechMerchant.  LOKE Network Zone: Guest network used for external consultants, other guests, BYOD devices, etc. This is the only network that has wireless access points connected. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 30\\n HEJMDAL Network Zone: Management network from which PCIData Hosting manages the different client networks that do not fall into PCI scope. This network is only used to manage non- CDE servers.  BALDER: All other clients are hosted on this network, including PCIData Hosting’s own office network. All networks are separated by firewalls, and access to ODIN and THOR network segments is restricted to two-factor authentication. The only wireless network is connected to LOKE (the guest network). The datacenter is located at PCIData Hosting’s location and is also in scope for PCI compliance. High-Level Network Diagram Success Criteria – The success criteria for the penetration test is to gain access to the CDE. Resource List (CDE environment)  ODIN – VMware servers  THOR – UNIX-based servers including webservers; Oracle databases in a secure zone  All employees at PCIData Hosting use Microsoft-based workstations to access the CDE environment. Pre-Engagement Actives (Planning) The methodology used for the penetration test was based on NIST SP800-115; the penetration test included the following phases: Planning, Discovery, Attack/Execution, Post-Execution and Reporting. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not 31\\nThe planning phase was used to gather information needed for the assessment execution—such as the assets to be assessed, the threats of interest against the assets, and the security controls to be used to mitigate those threats—and to develop the assessment approach. The networks ODIN (VMware) and THOR (CDE Servers) are the targets of the penetration test as these servers are those that store, process, and transmit cardholder data. Scoping Discussion It was discussed with PCIData Hosting how they managed their CDE environment, including servers and databases. The operating systems are administrated by PCIData Hosting; all applications and development are handled by TechMerchant. Both PCIData Hosting and TechMerchant administer databases. Encrypted information in the database is only accessible with the encryption keys that are held by TechMerchant. All access to ODIN and THOR are authenticated by a two-factor solution. This also applies when accessed from internal networks at PCIData Hosting. TechMerchant’s last penetration test was reviewed to make sure that all perimeters, servers, etc. were covered by the tests. The application was tested as a part of the TechMerchant’s annual PCI penetration test and is not considered in scope for PCIData Hosting’s PCI penetration test, therefore the focus is network- layer testing. The following documentation was reviewed before the assessment:  A network diagram", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Penetration-Testing-Guidance-v1_1", "chunk_id": 25}}
