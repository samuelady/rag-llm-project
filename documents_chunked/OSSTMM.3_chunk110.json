{"text": "terminal, PAP, CHAP, others). (g) Voice over IP testing: verify the possibility of performing toll fraud, call eavesdropping or tracing, call hijacking, CLID spoofing, and Denial of Service, using attacks targeting converging networks, VoIP network elements, signaling and media transport protocols. (h) X.25 packet switched network testing: find systems that are allowing remote administration, access to other services via specific CUDs, or reverse charge, verify how many Virtual Channels (VCs) and Permanent Virtual Channels (PVCs) are in use and how they are managed (CUG, sub-addresses mapping, incoming X.25 calls screening, filtering based on NUA, etc.). 10.5.2 Services (a) Request known, common remote services. (b) Identify the components of services and their versions. (c) Verify service uptime to latest vulnerabilities and patch releases. (d) For each identified service, remotely test, and document configuration errors. (e) For each identified application, remotely test, and document programming errors.

(b) Document the authentication schemes in use, verify the process for receiving authentication, and test for logic errors. (c) Verify the methods of authorization and the identification required. (d) Ensure administrative accounts do not have default or easily guessed credentials. (e) Ensure user accounts do not have default or easily guessed credentials. (f) Verify and test protections against brute force and dictionary type attacks. (g) Verify and test password complexity checks and voice mailbox PIN size, password aging, and frequency of change controls. (h) Try “known” credentials on all enumerated access points, to verify password re-usage controls. (i) Verify the format used for storage of authentication credentials and document clear-text or obfuscated passwords and weak encryption algorithms. (j) Verify the format used for transmission of authentication credentials through the network and document clear-text or obfuscated passwords and weak encryption algorithms. (k) Verify that authentication information whether attempted, successful, or failed. is appropriately logged. 10.6 Trust Verification Tests for trusts between systems within the scope, where trust refers to access to information or physical property without the need for authentication credentials. 10.6.1 Spoofing (a) Test and document the access methods in use that do not require submission of authentication credentials. (b) Test and document the depth of requirements for interaction with and access to property within the scope by means of spoofing a trusted source (example: CLID and X.25 NUA spoofing). 10.6.2 Resource Abuse (a) Test and document the depth of requirements to take property outside of the scope to a known and trusted source or throughout the scope itself without any established, required credentials. (b) Test and document the property available from outside of the scope due to information leaks.

The control of alarm is verified at the end of the methodology. 10.7.1", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 110}}
