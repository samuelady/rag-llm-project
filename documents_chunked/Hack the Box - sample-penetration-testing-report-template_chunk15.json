Root The web application exposes a directory listing of some files in the web root and subfolders. Cause) The severity of this finding depends on the sensitivity of the files exposed on the web server. If the directory exposes only files intended for public consumption, then the risk is lower but if Security Impact an attacker can gain access to sensitive information such as configuration files, they may be able to use these to gain further access to the application or web server. Affected Host(s)  192.168.195.215 (80/TCP) Restrict access to files and directories based on the concept of least privilege. Enforce Remediation authentication wherever possible and disable directory listing in the web server configuration. https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083/ External References https://www.acunetix.com/blog/articles/directory-listing-information-disclosure/ Finding Evidence: Using a web browser, browsing to the affected host lists the directory contents.

Root It appeared that Inlanefreight did not notice “noisy” activities during the course of testing. The Cause) tester was also not blocked when using standard open-source penetration testing tools. If network and endpoint detection and response are inadequate, an attacker who can gain a Security Impact foothold in the internal network may be able to move laterally, perform post-exploitation, and achieve persistence easily. Consider investing in a more advanced network monitoring solution, configuring logging on all hosts, and processing them for anomalies using a SIEM tool, and implementing endpoint detection on each server and workstation that is more difficult to bypass and tamper with. The Remediation organization should not rely on endpoint protection alone. When combined with a defense-in- depth security strategy, they can be an excellent tool for detecting an attacker who gains internal network access and is forced to perform “noisier” and riskier activities to the nature of the hardened environment.

The rating is based off of an assessment of the priority with which each finding should be viewed and the potential impact each has on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Inlanefreight’s data. Rating Severity Rating Definition Exploitation of the technical or procedural vulnerability will cause substantial harm. Significant political, financial, and/or legal damage is likely to result. The threat exposure is high, thereby increasing the likelihood of High occurrence. Security controls are not effectively implemented to reduce the severity of impact if the vulnerability were exploited. Exploitation of the technical or procedural vulnerability will significantly impact the confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of the system, application, or data. Exploitation of the vulnerability may cause moderate financial loss or public embarrassment. The threat exposure is moderate-to-high, thereby increasing the likelihood of occurrence. Security controls are in place to contain the severity of impact if the vulnerability were Medium exploited, such that further political, financial, or legal damage will not occur. -", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Hack the Box - sample-penetration-testing-report-template", "chunk_id": 15}}
