{"text": "to access anyone else’s phone line, a voice mail system that provides messages from any phone anywhere, or a FAX machine that can be polled remotely to resend the last thing in memory to the caller’s number. In SPECSEC, a vulnerability can be hardware which can be overloaded and burnt out by higher powered versions of the same frequency or a near frequency, a standard receiver without special configurations which can access the data in the signal, a receiver which can be forced to accept a third-party signal in place of the intended one, or a wireless access point dropping connections near a microwave oven.

In PHYSSEC, a weakness can be a door lock that opens when a card is wedged between it and the door frame, a back-up generator with no fuel, or insurance that doesn’t cover flood damage in a flood zone. In HUMSEC, a weakness can be a process failure of a second guard to take the post of the guard who runs after an intruder or a cultural climate within a company for allowing friends into posted restricted spaces. In COMSEC data security, a weakness can be a log-in that allows 2 Weakness unlimited attempts or a web farm with round-robin DNS for load balancing yet each system also has a unique name for direct linking. In COMSEC telecommunications, a weakness can be a PBX that still has the default administration passwords or a modem bank for remote access dial-in which does not log the caller numbers, time, and duration. In SPECSEC, a weakness can be a wireless access point authenticating users based on MAC addresses (which can be spoofed) or an RFID security tag that no longer receives signals and therefore fails “open” after receiving a signal from a high power source. Count each flaw or error in process controls: non-repudiation, confidentiality, privacy, integrity, and alarm. In PHYSSEC, a concern can be a door lock mechanism whose operation controls and key types are public, a back-up generator with no power meter or fuel gauge, an equipment process that does not require the employee to sign-out materials when received, or a fire alarm not loud enough to be heard by machine workers with ear plugs. In HUMSEC, a concern can be a process failure of a guard who maintains the same schedule and routine or a cultural climate within a company that allows employees to use public meeting rooms for internal business. 3 Concern In COMSEC data security, a concern can be the use of locally generated web server certificates for HTTPS or log files which record only the transaction participants and not the correct date and time of the transaction. In COMSEC telecommunications, a concern can be the use of a FAX machine for sending private information or a voice mail system that uses touch tones for entering a", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 63}}
