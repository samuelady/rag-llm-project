{"text": "substantially thorough application of this methodology. The steps in this application can be summarized as follows: 1. Passively collect data of normal operations to comprehend the target. 2. Actively test operations by agitating operations beyond the normal baseline. 3. Analyze data received directly from the operations tested. 4. Analyze indirect data from resources and operators (i.e. workers, programs). 5. Correlate and reconcile intelligence from direct (step 3) and indirect (step 4) data test results to determine operational security processes. 6. Determine and reconcile errors. 7. Derive metrics from both normal and agitated operations. 8. Correlate and reconcile intelligence between normal and agitated (steps 1 and 2) operations to determine the optimal level of protection and control which would best be implemented. 9. Map the optimal state of operations (step 8) to processes (step 5). 10. Create a gap analysis to determine what enhancements are needed for processes governing necessary protection and controls (step 5) to achieve the optimal operational state (step 8) from the current one.

Since errors may not be the fault of the Analyst, the understanding of how and where errors can exist within a test is much more reasonable than expecting an Analyst to test without error. Furthermore, it is the Analyst who attempts what should not be possible that is most likely to encounter errors; therefore, denoting errors as a negative thing discounts the practice of thorough testing. Error Type Description Something determined as true is actually revealed false. The target response indicates a particular state as true although in reality 1 False Positive the state is not true. A false positive often occurs when the Analyst’s expectations or assumptions of what indicates a particular state do not hold to real-world conditions which are rarely black and white. Something determined as false is actually revealed as true. The target response indicates a particular state as not true although in reality the state is true. A false negative often occurs when the Analyst’s 2 False Negative expectations or assumptions about the target do not hold to real-world conditions, the tools are not adequate for the test, the tools are misused, or the Analyst lacks experience. A false negative can be dangerous as it is a misdiagnosis of a secure state when it does not exist. Something answers true to everything even if false. The target response indicates a particular state as true, however the target 3 Gray Positive is designed to respond to any cause with this state whether it is true or not. This type of security through obscurity may be dangerous, as the illusion cannot be guaranteed to work the same for all stimuli. Something answers false to everything even if true. The target response indicates a particular state as not true, however the", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 35}}
