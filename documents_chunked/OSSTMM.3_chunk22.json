{"text": "unlikely for this particular limitation. Since risk justifications are not a part of calculating an attack surface, all limitations discovered must still be counted within the attack surface regardless if best practice, common practice, or legal practice denotes it as not a risk. If it is not then the audit will not show a true representation of the operational security of the scope. Managing Limitations Another concept that must be taken into consideration is one of managing flaws and errors in an audit. The three most straightforward ways to manage limitations is to remove the problem area providing the interactive point altogether, fix them, or accept them as part of doing business known as the business justification. An audit will often uncover more than one problem per target. The Analyst is to report the limitations per target and not just which are the weak targets. These limitations may be in the protection measures and controls themselves, thus diminishing OpSec. Each limitation is to be rated as to what occurs when the problem is invoked, even if that invocation is theoretical or the verification is of limited execution to restrict actual damages. Theoretical categorization, where no verification could be made, is a slippery slope and should be limited to cases where verification would reduce the quality of operations. Then, when categorizing the problems, each limitation should be examined and calculated in specific terms of operation at its most basic components. However, the Analyst should be sure never to report a “flaw within a flaw” where the flaws share the same component and same operational effect. An example of this would be a door broken open with a broken window. The door opening is an Access even if the broken window is also but both are for the same component, the door way, and same operational effect, an opening. An example from Data Networks would be a computer system which sends a kernel reply, such as an ICMP “closed port” T03C03 packet for a particular port. This interaction is not counted for all such ports since the Access comes from the same component, the kernel, and has the same operational effect, sending a T03C03 packet per port queried.

It’s like having ten ways of controlling threats that come through a hole in a wall. For each hole, a maximum of ten different controls can be applied which bring security back up towards and sometimes above 100%. Limitations then reduce the effectiveness of OpSec and Controls. The result of an audit which discovers and shows the Security, Controls, and Limitations is effectively demonstrating Actual Security. Actual Security is a term for a snapshot of an attack surface in an operational environment. It is a logarithmic representation of the Controls, Limitations, and OpSec at a particular moment in time. It is logarithmic because it represents the reality of size where a", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 22}}
