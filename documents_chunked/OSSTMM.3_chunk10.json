{"text": "certified by ISECOM. OSSTMM Seal of Approval OSSTMM evaluation seals are available for products, services, and business processes. This seal defines an operational state of security, safety, trust, and privacy. The successfully evaluated products, services, and processes carry their visible certification seal and rav score. This allows a purchaser to see precisely the amount and type of change in security that the evaluated solutions present. It removes the guesswork from procurement and allows one to find and compare alternative solutions.

This is how the OSSTMM itself had been approached as a means of understanding the best, most efficient, and most thorough way to test security. Therefore, we needed to understand security. This research seeking the “security particle” as it turns out has brought about the application and design of more projects beyond the OSSTMM. While not all applications of the OSSTMM to areas outside of security testing are worthy of being projects. However, some do provide a testament to the fact that we are now only limited by our own imaginations. The OSSTMM has become a tool with which we can take new approaches to many new means of protection. Source Code Analysis Risk Evaluation (SCARE) The SCARE project applies the OSSTMM ravs to source code analysis. The end result is a SCARE value which is the amount of the source code with unprotected operations. http://www.isecom.org/scare Home Security Methodology and Vacation Guide (HSM) The HSM project applies the OSSTMM ravs, Four Point Process, Trust Metrics, and analysis process to protecting and fortifying a home. The end result is to create a home that is safer and more secure without restricting the freedoms of the occupants. http://www.isecom.org/hsm Hacker Highschool (HHS) HHS is a different kind of security awareness program for teens. It uses the OSSTMM testing and analysis research to provide knowledge and skills through hands-on lessons and access to an Internet-based test network. However while doing so, it reinforces resourcefulness and critical thinking skills. http://www.hackerhighschool.org The Bad People Project (BPP) The BPP is a different kind of security and safety awareness program for children and parents. It uses OSSTMM ravs and Trust Metrics to create better rules for children about safety and security to be explained through games, stories, and role play. The rules are easier to remember and free of contradictions and cultural biases. The parents can visit and contribute to the gallery of children’s drawings which examines what children think what a bad person looks like. These drawings are the further used to find new ways to reach children and improve the rules taught to them. http://www.badpeopleproject.org Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution-Non-Commercial-NoDerivs 2010, ISECOM, www.isecom.org, www.osstmm.org 17\\nSecurity Operations Maturity Architecture (SOMA) The SOMA project aims to provide the OSSTMM operational processes at the strategic level.
