This is most often seen in Human Security where Human Resources departments research a candidate before the hire and afterward that person has continuous access to resources until they are no longer an employee. Re-authentication is then done seldom or sporadically and rarely at the same depth as when hired. In operational security, Trust is merely a contributor to porosity, just another interaction to control. It differs from Access (the other form of interaction), in how it relates to other targets within the scope. So where Access is interaction between two sides of a vector into and out of the scope, Trust is measured as the interactions between targets within the scope. However, most people don’t use trust so concretely. Trust is usually applied to a specific person or item and a specific act such as, “Can I trust this employee to deliver before the deadline?” or “Can I trust this computer?”. There are correct answers for these questions but people often lack the skills needed to quantify the level of Trust for that person or object which would let us make a more rational and logical decision. However, to quantify trust, we need to first understand it. 5.1 Understanding Trust Trust is a decision. While some people claim it is an emotion, like love, or a feeling, like pain, its clearly a complex quality we humans are born with. Unlike an emotion or a feeling, we can choose to trust or not to trust someone or something even if it feels wrong to do so. It appears that we are capable to rationalize in a way to supersede how we feel about trusting a target. This means we can quantify it by applying a logical process. It also means we can assign trust values to objects and processes as well as people based on these values. This brings new power to those who can analyze trust and make decisions based on that analysis. It also means Analysts with this skill can better control bias, identify fallacies (especially those from authoritative or trusted sources), and handle unknowns for transparent reporting. One point to note, however once the trust is quantified, it is only a vehicle for rationalizing the trust. It will not make something feel trustworthy now or in the future. Some people have strong feelings of aversion or attraction which may be at odds with the facts. As part of OpSec, trust is one part of a target’s porosity. Where security is like a wall that separates threats from assets, trust is a hole in that wall. It is wherever the target accepts interaction from other targets within the scope. However, people tend to use improper or incomplete operational controls with their trusts like authentication that has been made with improper identification such as a voice over a telephone, a business card, or even just the assumption that because a person is in the room that they are authorized to be there.
