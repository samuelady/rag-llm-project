Demo Corp BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL Page 29 of 38\\nFinding IPT-018: Insufficient Hardening – Listable Directories (High) Description: Demo Corp disclosed information by allowing listable directories and storing potentially critical items on web server. It is strongly recommended that Demo Corp perform a thorough web app assessment on this resource. Risk: Likelihood: Moderate – Adversaries will discovery content with open source tools. Impact: High – Attackers use this information in conjunction with other attacks for enumeration and cataloging for rapid attacks when vulnerabilities arise. System: Full list of discovered listable directories: [file removed] Tools Used: Manual Review References: NIST SP800-53r4 CM-7 - Least Functionality NIST SP800-53r4 AC-6(3) - Least Privilege Evidence Figure 18: Listable directory Remediation Restrict access and conduct web app assessment. Demo Corp BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL Page 30 of 38\\nFinding IPT-019: Unauthenticated SMB Share Access (Moderate) Description: Demo Corp exposed multiple servers with unauthenticated file server access. Risk: Likelihood: Moderate – Adversaries will discover these shares with low-noise, basic reconnaissance techniques. Impact: Moderate – Attackers learn about the environment through information leaks. System: 10.x.x.x Tools Used: Nessus, smbclient References: NIST SP800-53r4 AC-6(3) - Least Privilege NIST SP800-53 r4 SC-4 - Information in Shared Resources Evidence Figure 19: Unauthenticated Share access Remediation Disable SMB share or require authentication. Enabling authentication on the share will protect the confidentiality of the stored information. Exporting authentication logs to a SIEM solution will give incident response teams insights to brute force login attempts. Demo Corp BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL Page 31 of 38\\nFinding IPT-020: Insufficient Patch Management – SMBv1 (Moderate) Description: Demo Corp failed to patch SMBv1. This version is vulnerable to multiple denial of service and remote code execution attacks. TCM Security confirmed that the vulnerability likely exists but did not attempt the exploit to prevent any denial of service. Risk: Likelihood: Moderate – Basic scans would identify the SMB version but would require an adversary to be on the internal network and identify an exploit. Impact: Moderate – If exploited, an attacker gains denial of service and code execution capability. System: 10.x.x.x Tools Used: Nessus, Nmap References: https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/filecab/2016/09/16/stop-using-smb1/ NIST SP800-53 r4 SI-2 - Flaw Remediation Evidence Figure 20: Unauthenticated Share access Remediation Upgrade to SMBv3 and apply latest patching. Demo Corp BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL Page 32 of 38\\nFinding IPT-021: IPMI Hash Disclosure (Moderate) Description: Demo Corp deployed remote host supporting IPMI v2.0. The (IPMI) protocol is affected by an information disclosure vulnerability due to the support of RMCP+ Authenticated Key-Exchange Protocol (RAKP) authentication. A remote attacker can obtain password hash information for valid user accounts via the HMAC from a RAKP message 2 response from a BMC. Risk: Likelihood: High – Basic network scans will identify this vulnerability. Impact: Moderate – If exploited, an attacker can gain access to sensitive management devices. TCMS was unable to crack any hashes during the assessment. System: Identified 34 machines, please see the below file for listing.
