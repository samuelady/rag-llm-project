{"text": "other guards have done. For the next audit, the Analyst may try the same badge again, attempt other means to gain entry through social engineering techniques, or try using a different badge. That guard, other guards that the guard may have spoken with, and any log records of either the successful or failed attempt are all memories of the Analyst, the technique, and should the guard know of the audit, the audit itself. However, should scenario 2 occur, it is possible that the interaction escalating through the additional techniques used by the Analyst means that scenario 2 is a more thorough test as more tests are made within the same interaction. It also means that the audit and the Analyst will more likely be remembered by the guard. If the Analyst does not gain entry at all, then the completeness of the test is limited as to when the Analyst ran out of techniques, with each failed technique making entry that much more difficult. If the Analyst goes through all techniques outlined by tasks in the methodology, then the tests have been completed. If not, then the tests not yet conducted need to be tried on a different guard with different results as different people behave differently. While this may seem to be a human problem, it is not. A door or window forced open too often will remain damaged until it is replaced. Physical use always results in physical deterioration. Even in wired communications, the act of snooping traffic will cause delays (sometimes noticeable) or change power consumption, both with either direct or indirect and often varied results.

Depending on the thoroughness, business, time allotment, and requirements of the audit, the Analyst may want to schedule the details of the audit by phase. There are four phases in the execution of this methodology: A. Induction Phase B. Interaction Phase C. Inquest Phase D. Intervention Phase Each phase lends a different depth to the audit, but no single phase is less important than another in terms of Actual Security. A. Induction Phase Every trip begins with a direction. In the induction phase, the Analyst begins the audit with an understanding of the audit requirements, the scope, and the constraints to the auditing of this scope. Often, the test type is best determined after this phase.
