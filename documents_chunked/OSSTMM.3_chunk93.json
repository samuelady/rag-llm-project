{"text": "and exposure. This includes, but is not limited to: quarantine rooms, long empty hallways, parking lots, large empty expanses, difficult or unnatural terrain, and guest or holding areas. (d) Verify that the lighting and visible contrast on approach to the target allows for interception of threats. 8.3.2 Reacting (a) Verify if interactive controls for the target will react timely to extreme environmental conditions according to the Environment review task of the Posture Review. (b) Verify if the target will react timely to a disturbance in air, water, and soil quality. (c) Verify if the target will react timely to critical noise disturbances. (d) Verify if the target will react timely to magnetic field disturbances. (e) Verify if the target will react timely to fires. (f) Verify if the target will react timely to denial of target access via blockade or quarantine. (g) Verify if the target will react timely to threats of fear, revolt, or violence within the scope. (h) Determine the finality of threat interception. 8.4 Visibility Audit Enumeration and verification tests for the visibility of targets and assets. In PHYSSEC, assets must also include supplies such as food, water, fuel, etc. and operational processes which may affect those supplies like the proper removal of waste and other contaminants, loading and unloading supply shipments, sleep and rest cycles, proper acclimatization, etc. 8.4.1 Reconnaissance (a) Map and detail the scope perimeter determined by visible and assisted viewing techniques, publicly accessible areas, public plans, and public sources. (b) Enumerate and detail targets and assets visible from outside the scope. (c) Enumerate and detail target traffic patterns, foot traffic, occupied areas, and sensors visible outside the scope. (d) Enumerate directories and internal telephone books identifying locations of sensitive information processing facilities that are not readily accessible by the public. (e) Map and enumerate the physical location and layout of the targets, the size and navigability of obstacles, barriers, and hazards which will increase time on target.

While access to walls and fences bordering property outside of the scope is a real scenario and one often used in an attack, this audit is limited to scope-only interaction to protect the property rights of third parties. 8.5.1 Enumeration (a) Map and explore the navigable of terrain, barriers, and obstacles into the scope to reach the targets and assets. Document all methods used and the results of those methods. (b) Map and verify all access points that allow stealthy or unmonitored, direct (3 seconds or less time on target) interaction with the target. (c) Verify the size and navigable of public and private access points and all paths to target. 8.5.2 Authentication (a) Enumerate and test for inadequacies which privileges are required to access, the process of obtaining those privileges, and assure that only identifiable, authorized, intended parties are provided access. (b) Verify the process of authenticating", "metadata": {"doc_id": "OSSTMM.3", "chunk_id": 93}}
