{"text": "progressed, New Haven Hacking Inc. was impeded by the security safe- guards AEC had in place. A number of basic security best practices were observed that limited New Haven Hacking Inc.’s ability to move through the network. Some instances of aforementioned security practices implemented by AEC include: • The usage of TLS on websites to protect information. • TheusageofCross-OriginResourceSharing(CORS)headerspreventedspecificattacks. • The marketplace & music player required authentication. • Some APIs required authentication in order to query sensitive information (although not all). These controls should be continuously monitored and regulated to maintain the company’s security posture. Page 5\\n2.3 Compliance 2.3.1 PCI DSS Violations The following table details violations of the PCI Data Security Standard discovered by New Haven Hacking Inc. over the scope of this engagement. Table 1: PCI DSS Compliance Violations. Regulation Reason Reference PCI DSS 1.1.4 A firewall is not implemented at every internet Section 4.5.1 connection. PCI DSS 1.2 The PostgreSQL server that stores cardholder Section 4.1.1 data does not have a firewall restricting con- nections from untrusted networks. PCI DSS 1.3 The PostgreSQL server is not segmented Section 4.1.1 through the use of a DMZ. PCI DSS 2.1 Default accounts were not removed from all Sections 4.1.1 systems on the network. PCI DSS 2.2 No evidence found to indicate that AEC has N/A configuration standards. PCI DSS 2.2.1 The server “charley” had more than one pri- Sections 4.1.1 & mary function implemented: MariaDB and 4.2.1 PostgreSQL. PCI DSS 2.2.2 No evidence of documentation for enabled in- N/A secure services, daemons, or protocols. PCI DSS 2.2.4 There were insecure security parameters Sections 4.1.1 present on system configurations. No found evidence of documented common system se- curity parameters and no evidence of system configuration standards. PCI DSS 2.4 An inventory of what was considered to be in N/A scope for PCI DSS was not provided to pen- etration testers nor found during the engage- ment. PCI DSS 2.5 No evidence of security policies and opera- N/A tional procedures was found during the en- gagement Page 6\\n3 Testing Methodology 3.1 Penetration Testing Execution Standard Throughout the engagement New Haven Hacking Inc., references the Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) when conducting security assessments [2]. Figure 2: PTES Methodology 3.2 MITRE ATT&CK Framework MITRE ATT&CK is a knowledge base of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) based upon real-world observations from security professionals. ATT&CK is a curated knowledge base for cyber adversary behavior, reflecting the attack lifecycle and platforms known to target. New Haven Hacking Inc. uses ATT&CK to aide in understanding TTPs that can be used to conduct an attack against AEC that could be conduct by real world adversaries [3]. 3.3 OWASP Top 10 Referenced in this report is the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10 when applications are found within the applicable scope [4]. OWASP Top 10 focuses vulner- abilities focus on common vulnerabilities that pose security risks to web applications: Table 2: OWASP Top 10 1. Broken Access Controls 6.
