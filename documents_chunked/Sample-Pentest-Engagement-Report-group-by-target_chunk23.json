Risk description The risk exists that a remote unauthenticated attacker can fully compromise the server to steal confidential information, install ransomware, or pivot to the internal network. Recommendation Apply the necessary patches or updates provided by Oracle to mitigate this vulnerability.

We extracted the following information from the target: pentest-ground.com:6379 Authentication was performed without credentials. Username: \"\" Password: \"\" Vulnerability description Redis service was accessed with easily guessed credentials. Risk description The risk exist that a remote attacker could take advantage of the default credentials for taking over the default account. If an authenticated vulnerability is present on the machine, it could also be leveraged to exploit the target, compromising the underlying system. Recommendation Change the default login credentials. Use a strong password, at least 10 characters long, preferably randomly generated. Unless the login panel is intended to be exposed to the internet, we strongly recommend placing it behind a firewall.
