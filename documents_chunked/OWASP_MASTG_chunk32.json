Mobile Platform Providers Google Android Since 2021 Google has shown their support for the OWASP Mobile Security project (MASTG/MASVS) and has started providingcontinuousandhighvaluefeedbacktotheMASVSrefactoringprocessviatheAppDefenseAlliance(ADA)and itsMASA(MobileApplicationSecurityAssessment)program. With MASA, Google has acknowledged the importance of leveraging a globally recognized standard for mobile app se- curityto the mobile appecosystem.
