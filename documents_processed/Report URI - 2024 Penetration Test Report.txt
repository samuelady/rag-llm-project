Report URI are the best real-time monitoring platform for cutting edge web standards. Their experience, focus, and exposure allow them to take the hassle out of collecting, processing, and understanding reports, giving customers just the information they need. Report URI have indicated the need for a repeat security test of their ‘Report URI’ application in order to identify vulnerabilities to attacks that could be launched across a computer network, and to provide security assurances regarding their systems. Such a test will allow Report URI to undertake remediation efforts and increase their overall security posture. 2.1 Scope & Duration This assessment included the following phase of work: • Phase 1 – Web application assessment of Report URI application The duration included 5 days effort (including reporting). Work commenced on 11/11/2024 and concluded on 19/11/2024. 2.2 Scenarios Included • Black-Box assessment – testing the web application while unauthenticated without additional information. This simulates a real-world threat posed to all Internet facing services. • Rogue-User Scenario – using credentials provided to simulate the risk as various levels of user account. This simulates the risk of a user either by choice or by being compromised attacking the system. • White-box assessment – using the source code provided. All the tests were performed against the production environment. 2.3 Target(s) • https://report-uri.com Confidential 4 3756 – Web App Test\nConfidential 5 3756 - App Test <CustomerNameLong> 3 Executive Summary Overall, the Report URI application performed well during the assessment. It demonstrated a strong performance throughout the engagement, effectively thwarting attempts by authenticated attackers to exploit vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting that could potentially compromise the server or application. The application also had proper user access controls in place and showed no signs of an attack surface for authorisation-based attacks. Only low-severity issues were identified that should be resolved to add additional layers of security to the application and further harden it. Full details of each issue as well as recommended remedial actions can be found documented in the Technical Findings section. 3.1 Next Steps A complete writeup of every issue is available in the body of this report. It includes required steps to confirm and replicate each issue, along with recommended remedial actions. Pentest recommend taking time to review the findings before arranging a triage meeting to determine the order of priority for remedial work. As a rule of thumb: • Low and Info Risk Items – Track these within a risk register and discuss remediation versus acceptance. If recommendations within this report are followed Pentest believe that the target’s security posture will improve. 3.2 Caveats Pentest provides no warranty that the target(s) are now free from other defects. Security is an ever- evolving field and consultancy is based on the opinions of the consultant, their understanding of the goals of Report URI as well as their individual experience. The findings of this project are based on a time-limited assessment and by necessity can only focus on approved targets which are in scope. An attacker would not be constrained by either time or scope limits and could circumvent controls which are impractical to assess via structured penetration testing. To appropriately secure assets Pentest encourage a cyclical approach to assessment. Each cycle should include: • Comprehensive Assessment – where a full list of findings is produced with the widest scope possible. • Focused Verification Testing – where solutions to the initial assessment’s findings are verified. Depending on how important the target is to the concerns of Report URI, Pentest recommend repeating the cycle every 6-months or 12-months at least. Confidential 5 3756 – Web App Test\nConfidential 6 3756 - App Test <CustomerNameLong> 3.3 Risk Categories & Rationales Pentest use a simple risk categorisation of each vulnerability to focus the triage process at the risks which truly matter. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an industry standard formula. It generates a risk score between 0.0 and 10.0. The table below explains the risk categories and demonstrates rule-of-thumb equivalency with CVSS scores: Risk Category CVSS Score Rationales 8.1 – 10.0 Poses a severe risk which is easy to exploit. Begin the process of remediating immediately after the issue has been presented. 6.1 – 8.0 Poses a significant risk and can be exploited. Address these as soon as possible after any critical risks have been remediated. 4.1 – 6.0 Poses an important risk but may be difficult to exploit. Pentest recommends remedial work within 3 months of discovery. 2.1 – 4.0 Poses a minor risk or may be exceedingly difficult to exploit. Address these over the long-term during testing cycles. 0.0 – 2.0 Loss of sensitive information, or a discussion point. These are not directly exploitable but may aid an attacker. Remediate these to create a true defence-in-depth security posture. CVSS is not applicable to all risks. For example, it is incapable of capturing the risk of a “flat network design”. Experience has told us that this is a “high” risk in most cases. For this reason, the reader may find vulnerabilities which have no CVSS rating in our reports. We endeavour to provide the reason for omitting the risk score when that is the case, and to provide CVSS by default in all applicable cases.

Confidential 8\n5 Technical Findings 5.1 Vulnerabilities in Outdated Dependencies Detected 5.1.1 Background Most software products are developed using APIs or libraries provided by third parties. Doing so reduces development time and cost and feeds into the “why re-invent the wheel?” philosophy. Once a component has been integrated into an application it must be upgraded regularly to guard against bugs and remove publicly known vulnerabilities. Failure to do so can mean that the application itself is at risk of exploitation due to weaknesses that exist in the supporting dependencies. This risk has been captured by the OWASP top 10 2021 project as category A06 labelled “Vulnerable and Outdated Components” defined at reference [1]. 5.1.2 Details During the assessment a few supporting JavaScript libraries were identified which contained publicly disclosed vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting. The table below identifies the location within the application and the related CVE associated with directly related vulnerabilities. Component version Location implemented Vulnerability CVE Bootstrap 3.4.1 https://cdn.report- Cross-Site Scripting CVE-2024-6484 uri.com/libs/twitter- bootstrap/3.4.1/js/bootstra p.min.js Select 4.2 https://cdn.report- Cross-Site Scripting CVE-2016-10744 uri.com/libs/select2/3.5.2/ select2.min.js Additionally, Bootstrap version 3.4.1 currently reached EOL (end of life) and no longer receive any updates from the vendor, which exacerbates this issue. More information about Bootstrap’s version 3 reaching EOL is available in reference [4]. Confidential 9\n5.1.3 Risk Analysis Pentest Risk Category CVSS 3.1/Low AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L Explanation The risk associated with this issue was considered low, as no areas of the application were found to reflect user inputs without appropriate HTML encoding. Moreover, the application implemented a strict CSP. The issue is raised to encourage updating the affected libraries and is not believed to constitute an immediate threat to Report URI or its users. 5.1.4 Recommendation The immediate recommendation is to download and integrate the latest supported versions of each outdated dependency. Pentest understands that this would be a significant undertaking for radius, due to changes in the underlying APIs and updated versions of the dependencies. As such, to ensure that updated components do not affect the user experience, a full User Acceptance Testing (UAT) would need to be carried out. The advice above would triage the initial problem only and would not prevent the situation from recurring. The long-term solution is to modify the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to ensure that dependencies are regularly updated. OWASP provides a free tool called “dependency-check” (see reference [2]) which can be integrated into most build processes. 5.1.5 References [1] OWASP Top 10: A06_2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components [2] OWASP: OWASP Dependency Check [3] TaringAmberini: Ready to use Java Dependencies Vulnerability Checker [4] GitHub – Bootstrap version 4 issue 5.1.6 Affected Item(s) • https://report-uri.com Confidential 10\n5.2 No Anti-Automation Protection 5.2.1 Background Web applications are subjected to unwanted automated usage. Usually, these events occur due to an improper usage of an existing functionality rather than the exploitation of vulnerabilities. Also, excessive misuse is commonly mistakenly reported as application Denial-of-Service (DoS) like HTTP-flooding, when in fact the DoS is a side-effect instead of the primary intent. Insufficient anti-automation occurs when a web application permits an attacker to automate a process that was originally designed to be performed only in a manual fashion, i.e. by a human web user 5.2.2 Details The application did implement anti-automation measures to protect against excessive automated requests. However, as the CloudFlare Bot Management was disabled for the test, remote attackers were able to send many requests to access or generate data. Although the application used CSRF tokens and validated them properly, it was possible to reuse the CSRF token because a non-standard client (Burp Suite) was used during testing. This client enabled manual manipulation and replay of HTTP requests, bypassing the typical flow of the application and allowing automation. Below is one request issued by the application to create a team: POST /team/create_team/ HTTP/2 Host: report-uri.com Cookie: _nss=1; __cf_bm=lYfP1QOpjdweC0p5pHFLAAvVIv1d91kYWSuu5nMGg5M-1731935807-1.0.1.1- ne_YxFLihgBqNOL5ndq8LwzKFHp5eFI7JSLlzYTJQtjdfQT8KX1YfX8kyMGMlnqzAE8eAKd90S.lm2x0AJ0KlA; __Host-report_uri_csrf=ec6c3b4d5aa5e5f8ffb26bd9e5f33c83; __Host- report_uri_sess=c3k0adha2690t2qlqnspbbtr30 [...] Referer: https://report-uri.com/account/teams/ csrf_token=ec6c3b4d5aa5e5f8ffb26bd9e5f33c83&name=Test%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C%2Fsc ript The following image shows the teams that were created by the consultant: Figure 1 – CSRF token reuse Confidential 11\n5.2.3 Risk Analysis Pentest Risk Category CVSS 3.1/Low AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L Explanation The risk rating has been set to "Low" since testing was conducted with Cloudflare Bot Management disabled. However, it is unlikely that Cloudflare Bot Management would have prevented this brute-force attempt under normal conditions, as only 6 requests were issued within a short time frame. The limited request volume would likely not trigger typical rate-limiting or anomaly detection mechanisms, making this vulnerability feasible for exploitation in scenarios with similar traffic patterns. 5.2.4 Recommendation Pentest recommends implementing anti-automation controls on the affected forms. By significantly delaying the success of a password-guessing attack, it provides an effective deterrent to attackers. Consider the following options to reduce the effectiveness of automated bot attacks: • CAPTCHA can help prevent automated bots by requiring manual interactions from a human. For example, Google’s ReCAPTCHA asks the user to identify an object (such as a car or traffic light) from a photo. • Rate-Limiting Requests simply reduces the number of requests an attacker can be made within reasonable time period to the server. 5.2.5 References [1] OWASP: Automated Threats to Web Applications 5.2.6 Affected Item(s) • https://report-uri.com Confidential 12\n6 6 Additional Information 6.1 WHOIS Database The WHOIS database stores information about the individual or organisation who owns and manages a domain or IP address range. Attackers will review WHOIS entries trying to find useful information such as names and contact details for employees. Best practices state that generic contact details should be used such as “whois@domain.com” rather than providing the name of a member of staff. 6.1.1 Entry for Domain: report-uri.com Domain Name: REPORT-URI.COM Registry Domain ID: 1651365076_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN Registrar WHOIS Server: whois.namecheap.com Registrar URL: http://www.namecheap.com Updated Date: 2024-03-18T08:02:32Z Creation Date: 2011-04-17T11:55:31Z Registry Expiry Date: 2025-04-17T11:55:31Z Registrar: NameCheap, Inc.

Each open port creates a communication channel which can pose a security risk that an attacker can enumerate information from, or at worst exploit to compromise the target. Best practices state that only the minimum number of open ports should be enabled to reduce the attack surface. 6.2.1 Target: 104.17.215.66 – report-uri.com Port State Service Product Version Extra 80/tcp open http cloudflare Unknown Unknown 443/tcp open https cloudflare Unknown Unknown 2052/tcp open clearvisn Unknown Unknown Unknown 2053/tcp open http nginx Unknown Unknown 2082/tcp open infowave Unknown Unknown Unknown 2083/tcp open http nginx Unknown Unknown 2086/tcp open gnunet Unknown Unknown Unknown 2087/tcp open http nginx Unknown Unknown 2095/tcp open nbx-ser Unknown Unknown Unknown 2096/tcp open http nginx Unknown Unknown 8080/tcp open http-proxy cloudflare Unknown Unknown 8443/tcp open https-alt cloudflare Unknown Unknown 8880/tcp open cddbp-alt Unknown Unknown Unknown Confidential 15\n6.3 SSL/TLS Assessment Transport Layer Security (TLS) is used to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of traffic as it transits a network.
